1.    Leave granted.

2.     Chandigarh,  which  is  known  all  over  the  world  as  ‘the   City
Beautiful’, was planned by French  Architect  Monsieur  Le  Corbusier.   The
plan prepared by Le Corbusier in collaboration with  two  other  architects,
namely, Maxwell Fry  and  Jane  Drew  envisaged  division  of  the  city  of
Chandigarh into residential sectors with provision for markets,  educational
institutions, hospitals and other facilities.

3.    After finalisation of the plan,  the  Government  of  Punjab  acquired
land of various villages for establishing Chandigarh as the new  capital  of
the State and also  constituted  various  committees  including  Land  Scape
Committee for implementing the plan.  In  the  meeting  of  the  Land  Scape
Committee held on  3.9.1954,  the  Divisional  Forest  Officer,  Rupar  (now
Ropar) suggested that the land lying along the right  bank  of  Sukhna  Choe
and the left bank of Patiala Ki Rao where plantation  had  been  started  by
the Forest Department should be declared as reserved forest under Section  4
of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900. This was  approved  by  the  Land
Scape Committee, and  Chief  Engineer,  P.W.D.  was  asked  to  furnish  the
details of the area. On receipt  of  necessary  details  of  khasra  numbers
together  with  the  plan  of  the  area,  which  included  residential  and
commercial plots, preliminary notification under Section  4  of  the  Indian
Forest Act, 1927 was issued by the State Government on 28.2.1956  and  final
notification under Section 20 of that Act was issued on  3.2.1961  declaring
6724.19 acres land including about 6000 acres land which  had  already  been
utilised for construction of the first phase of Chandigarh,  and  about  280
acres land falling in  the  revenue  estates  of  village  Hallo  Majra  and
village Dalheri Rajputan as  reserved  forest.  The  State  Government  also
acquired hilly area measuring 6172.09 acres of Sukhna lake catchment  during
1961-62, 1962-63 and 1963-64 for carrying out  soil  conservation  works  to
reduce the silt in-flow  into  the  lake.  The  Forest  Department  acquired
536.64 acres of land of various villages along Sukhna  Choe  during  1963-64
to carry out soil conservation and other improvemental works.

4.    In 1966,  the  State  of  Punjab  was  reorganised  under  the  Punjab
Reorganisation Act,  1966  (for  short,  ‘the  1966  Act’)  leading  to  the
creation of the new State of Haryana and the Union Territory  of  Chandigarh
and transfer of some territories to State of Himachal  Pradesh.  With  this,
6706 acres land out of 6724.19 acres land declared as reserved  forest  vide
notification dated 3.2.1961  was  transferred  to  the  Union  Territory  of
Chandigarh and 6127.09 acres of land constituting hilly  catchment  came  to
vest in the Central Government by virtue of Section 48(5) of the 1966 Act.

5.    With the passage of time, Chandigarh became an  important  destination
for education and attracted students from all over  the  country.   However,
the employment opportunities  available  in  the  city  did  not  match  the
educational  facilities  and  this  resulted  in  exodus  of   talent   from
Chandigarh  to  other  cities.   In  the  beginning  of  21st  Century   the
Chandigarh  Administration  took  steps  to   provide   various   incentives
including allotment of land to the  entrepreneurs  desirous  of  setting  up
industries in the field of information technology because that was  expected
to generate huge employment.  In  the  first  instance,  the  Administration
decided that 111 acres land, which had been acquired between 1950  and  1977
and was lying vacant,  may  be  utilised  for  establishing  a  world  class
Information Technology Park in the name of Late Prime  Minister  Shri  Rajiv
Gandhi (for short, ‘the IT Park’).  This area was designated as  Phase-I  of
the IT Park and the plots were allotted to the following:

7.    The land allotted to Wipro Technologies Ltd. (30 acres),  Rolta  India
Ltd. (2.98 acres) and e-Sys Technologies Ltd.  (6  acres)  was  subsequently
resumed because they failed to set up their units.
8.     Out of the remaining land of Phase-II, 135 acres was  transferred  to
the Chandigarh Housing Board (for  short,  ‘the  Board’)  vide  order  dated
15.11.2005/1.12.2005   issued   by   the   Finance   Secretary,   Chandigarh
Administration for development  of  residential  and  other  infrastructural
facilities in  the  IT  Park.  The  relevant  portions  of  that  order  are
extracted below:

           “1.    The  Administrator,  Union  Territory,  Chandigarh-,   is
                 pleased to order to the transfer of 135 acres  of  land  in
                 the Chandigarh Technology Park at Kishangarh in  favour  of
                 the Chandigarh Housing  Board,  Chandigarh,  on  free  hold
                 basis, for the execution of the project of development  and
                 residential and other  infrastructural  facilities  in  the
                 said park. The price of the land, details of the  land  use
                 and other terms and conditions of  transfer  of  this  land
                 will be decided later on.

           2.    The Administrator, Union Territory, Chandigarh is  further
                 pleased  to  designate  the   Chandigarh   Housing   Board,
                 Chandigarh as the Nodal Agency for executing the  aforesaid
                 project by engaging SBI Caps as consultants who would  help
                 fine tune the financial package, as also  prepare  the  old
                 document.

           3.    Broad guidelines are spelt out hereunder:-

                 I.    The whole exercise would involve a joint venture with
                       the private party through an agreement,  but  without
                       creating a joint venture company.

                 II.   No capital expenditure would be involved on the  part
                       of the Chandigarh Administration.

                 III.  The building and sale of all property would  be  left
                       to the private party but all money will  be  received
                       in the first instant by the Chandigarh Housing  Board
                       so  that  there  is  no  under  reporting  of   gross
                       revenues.

           4.    The Chandigarh Housing Board  will  complete  the  process
                 preliminary to the inviting of bids in 12 weeks or  so  and
                 complete the work construction of  the  building  within  a
                 period of 18 months or so.”




9.    Though, the ostensible object of transferring land to  the  Board  was
development of residential and other infrastructural facilities  in  the  IT
Park, the real purpose was  to  benefit  the  private  developers  and  this
became evident from the decision taken in the meeting  of  the  officers  of
the Chandigarh Administration held on 30.3.2006. Paragraphs 1(a),  8  and  9
of the minutes of that meeting are reproduced below:

           “1.       Land Allotment.

               a) The entire land including land under  commercial  will  be
                  allotted to CHB on  free  hold  basis,  however  CHB  will
                  transfer the land under commercial use on lease hold basis
                  as per the prevalent policy of Chandigarh Administration.

           8.      Modalities      of     disposal       of   service/studio
                 apartments and commercial property

                 The service/studio apartments and the  commercial  property
                 shall be transferred to the developer on lease hold  basis.
                 The developer would be quoting and paying to CHB  one  time
                 cost of the service / studio apartments and the  commercial
                 property. 30% share will not be  taken  of  the  subsequent
                 revenues from these two properties.

           9.      10%     Reservation     for      allotment      to   I.T.
                 professionals.

                 10% dwelling units may be allowed to be purchased  by  I.T.
                 companies established in Chandigarh or its  employees.  The
                 detailed modalities will be worked out by CHB separately.”



10.   In furtherance of the aforesaid decision, the Board invited  bids  for
disposal of the land. M/s Parsvnath Developers Limited, who gave the bid  of
Rs.821.21 crores was allotted 123.79 acres land.  However, after  issuing  a
glamorous advertisement with the title Parsvnath –  PRIDE  ASIA,  Chandigarh
(An Address for  Aristocratic  Living)  to  attract  prospective  buyers  of
residential and commercial properties, M/s Parsvnath Developers  appears  to
have abandoned the project and raised certain  disputes  which  are  pending
before the arbitrator.

11.   Soon after transfer of almost half of the land acquired  for  Phase-II
to  a  private  developer,  Land  Acquisition  Officer,   Union   Territory,
Chandigarh  (hereinafter  described   as,   ‘the   LAO’)   sent   Memo   No.
Teh.(LA)/LAO/2005/37365  dated  15.12.2005  to  the  Director,   Information
Technology, Chandigarh with reference to  some  meeting  held  on  9.12.2005
under the Chairmanship of the  Finance  Secretary-cum-Secretary  Information
Technology, Chandigarh and asked him to provide  the  drawing  of  50  acres
land adjoining the IT Park  for  facilitating  its  acquisition.  That  memo
reads under:
      “From
            The Land Acquisition Officer,
            UT, Chandigarh.

      To
            The Director Information Technology,
            Chandigarh Administration,
            Chandigarh.

            Memo No. Teh (LA)/LAO/2005/37366
            Dated,   Chandigarh, the 15/12/05


             Subject  :   Acquisition  of  land  in  Village  Manimajra  for
            2nd phase of I.T. Park.

            This refers to minutes of the meeting held on  09.12.2005  under
      the chairmanship  of  Sh.  S.K.  Sandhu,  Finance  Secretary/Secretary
      Information Technology,  Chandigarh  Administration,  wherein  it  was
      emphasized to acquire 50 acres of land adjoining to the  present  I.T.
      Park in Kishangarh (Manimajra) for construction of 2nd  phase  of  IT.
      Park.
            You are, therefore, requested to provide  drawing  of  the  land
      required to be acquired so that further action to acquire the land  is
      initiated.
                                              Sd/-
                                   Land Acquisition Officer,
                                   UT, Chandigarh.”



12.   The aforesaid memo sent by the LAO was clearly misleading  because  in
the meeting held on 9.12.2005 no decision was taken for the  acquisition  of
50 acres land adjoining the IT Park.  This is evinced from the  contents  of
the minutes of the meeting held on 9.12.2005, which are reproduced below:
      “Minutes of the meeting held on 9.12.2005 under  the  Chairmanship  of

13.   The Director, Information Technology sent DO No. 107  dated  12.1.2006
to the LAO and requested him to take  action  as  per  the  minutes  of  the
meeting held on 9.12.2005.  In  turn,  the  LAO  sent  DO  No.1294-95  dated
16.01.2006 to the Director and  reiterated  the  instructions  contained  in
memo dated 15.12.2005. After 4 days, he sent letter dated 16.1.2006  to  the
Finance Secretary in the context  of  some  meeting  held  on  4.1.2006  and
pointed out that 280 acres land including 50 acres land already  decided  to
be acquired for IT Park was available for acquisition. That letter reads  as
under:
      “From


      The Land Acquisition Officer,
      UT, Chandigarh


      To,


      The Finance Secretary,
      Chandigarh Administration,
      Chandigarh.

      Memo No. Kgo (LA)/LAO/2006/1296
      Dated, Chandigarh, the 16/1/06


      Subject: Acquisition of remaining land in Village Manimajra, UT,
           Chandigarh.

      This refers to the minutes of the meeting held on 29.12.2005 under the
      chairmanship  of  the  Finance  Secretary-cum-Secretary,   Information
      Technology, Chandigarh  Administration,  Chandigarh,  wherein  it  was
      decided to acquire 50 acres of land adjoining to the present I.T. Park
      in village Kishangarh (Manimajra) for construction  of  2nd  phase  of
      I.T. Park.

      Accordingly, the Director Information Technology, UT, Chandigarh, vide
      this office Memo No.37365 dated 15.12.2005 was  requested  to  provide
      drawing of the land required to be acquired so that further action  is
      initiated, but no communication has been received till date.

      Subsequently, in a meeting held  on  04.01.2006,  it  was  desired  to
      acquire  the  land  of  Village  Manimajra  as  maximum  as  can   be.
      Accordingly, an intensive survey of the area has been  got  conducted,
      according to which it has been found that 280 acres of land in Village
      Manimajra is available for acquisition. It is clarified here that this
      280 acres include 50 acres of land already decided to be acquired  for
      I.T. Park. However, there are about 275 structures  in  the  shape  of
      small houses in the locality called ‘Shastri Nagar’, 32 Farm-houses, 2
      Nurseries and 2 Poultry-farms. The proposed land to  be  acquired  has
      been shown on the map enclosed herewith.

      If this land is decided to be  acquired,  a  sum  of  Rs.  165  crores
      (approximately) would be required on account of compensation for  land
      and trees/structures. It is pertinent to mention here that  the  farm-
      houses, in fact, are orchards having costly fruit-bearing trees, hence
      compensation of these fruit-bearing trees  would  be  invariably  very
      high.

      You are, therefore, requested to convey the decision on the  aforesaid
      proposal.

                                                    Land Acquisition Officer
                                                             UT, Chandigarh.
                                                              Dated:
      16/1/06”



14.   Since, there  was  some  confusion  about  the  date  of  the  meeting
mentioned in the first line of the aforementioned letter, Dr Rajeev  Dhawan,
learned senior counsel  for  the  Union  Territory  of  Chandigarh  gave  an
assurance on 6.9.2012, i.e., the date on which the order was reserved,  that
the relevant minutes will be handed over to the  Court  Master.  Thereafter,
Shri S. K.  Setia,  Joint  Secretary  (Estates),  Chandigarh  Administration
filed affidavit dated 10.9.2012, paragraph 4 whereof reads as under:

      “4.   That in response to  courts  query,  the  deponent  respectfully
      submits as under:

   i) There was no meeting held on 29.12.2005. This is a typographical error
      in the letter dated 16.01.2006. The correct date  of  the  meeting  is
      09.12.2005. This is self evident from various letters on the  original
      file which refer to 09.12.2005 which are explained and annexed  below.

  ii) There was a meeting held on 04.01.2006, which  was  attended  by  Land
      Acquisition  Officer;  Director,  IT  and  Jt.  Secretary   (Finance).
      However, no minutes were recorded for that meeting, which is  referred
      to in the letter dated 16.01.2006.”


15.   After three months, the Finance Secretary sent  memo  dated  18.4.2006
to the LAO requiring him to submit draft notification  for  the  acquisition
of 280 acres land in two parts. That letter reads as under:

      “From

           Memo No.43/3/157-UTFI(5)-06/2123
           Dated, Chandigarh the 18.4.06


      Subject:  -  Acquisition  of  land  measuring  280  acres  in  village
      Kishangarh (Manimajra).

            The matter regarding acquisition of land measuring 280 acres  in
      village Kishangarh Manimajra has been discussed for the development of
      2nd Phase of I.T. Park. It has been decided that the said land may  be
      acquired in 2 parts, i.e. (140 acres + 140 acres). Your are  therefore
      requested  to  take  immediate  necessary  action   and   send   draft
      notification U/s 4 of the Land Acquisition Act immediately so that the
      process of acquisition is started.

                                                      for Finance Secretary,
                                                 Chandigarh Administration.”





16.   In compliance of the directive given by  the  Finance  Secretary,  the
LAO sent the draft notification under Section 4(1) of the  Land  Acquisition
Act, 1894 (for short, ‘the Act’) for the acquisition of 104.83  acres  land.
The Adviser to the Administrator, Union Territory,  Chandigarh  (hereinafter
described as, ‘the Adviser’) accorded his approval on 27.6.2006 and  on  the
same day, the notification was sent for publication in the official  gazette
and the newspapers.  The public purpose specified in  the  notification  was
“the  provision  of  city  level   infrastructure,   the   regulated   urban
development of the area between Chandigarh and Mani Majra  and  the  planned
development and expansion of the Chandigarh  Technology  Park”.   The  first
four paragraphs of the notification read as under:

                   “CHANDIGARH ADMINISTRATION                 FINANCE
                                 DEPARTMENT
                                NOTIFICATION


                    No.43/3/229-UTF(5)-2006/       Dated:


      Whereas it appears to the Administrator, Union Territory,  Chandigarh,
      that the land in the locality specified below is likely to  be  needed
      for  a  public  purpose  namely  for  "the  provision  of  city  level
      infrastructure, the regulated urban development of  the  area  between
      Chandigarh and Mani Majra; the planned development  and  expansion  of
      Chandigarh Technology Park' in the  village  Mani  Majra,  H.B.No.375,
      Union Territory, Chandigarh.

      Now, therefore, this Notification under the provisions of Section 4 of
      the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 for the information  of  all  concerned
      that it is hereby notified that the land in the said locality is to be
      needed for the said purpose.

      And in exercise of the powers conferred by the aforesaid Section  read
      with Government of  India,  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  Notification
      Number  3612  dated  8th  October,  1968,  the  Administrator,   Union
      Territory, Chandigarh, is pleased to authorize the  Officers  for  the
      time being engaged in undertaking this work with  their  servants  and
      workmen to enter upon and survey the land in the locality and  do  all
      other acts required or permitted by that Section.

      The person interested can file their objections under Section  5-A  of
      the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, within one month from the  publication
      of the Notification  before  the  Land  Acquisition  Collector,  Union
      Territory, Chandigarh.”



17.   On 2.8.2006, another notification was issued for  the  acquisition  of
167.50 acres land for the same purpose.

18.   Surinder Singh Brar, who is one of the appellants  in  the  lead  case
submitted  representation  dated  12.7.2006  to  the  Administrator,   Union
Territory, Chandigarh (hereinafter described as,  ‘the  Administrator’)  and
prayed that the land in question may not be acquired  because  large  number
of trees had been grown by the landowners  and  cutting  of  the  same  will
adversely impact the  environment  and  ecology  of  the  area.   Shri  Brar
emphasized that the land already acquired for IT Park was  lying  unutilized
and, therefore, there was no justification to acquire additional land.   The
Administrator rejected the representation  of  Shri  Brar  vide  his  letter
dated 31.7.2006, which is reproduced below:

           “General (Retd.) S.F. Rodrigues        RAJ BHAVAN
                         PVSM, VSM                         CHANDIGARH
           160019
                    Governor of Punjab          JULY 31, 2006
                              and
                      Administrator
           Union Territory, Chandigarh


                 I am in receipt of  your  representation  dated  12.7.2006
           regarding land acquisition & related issues. The  issues  raised
           mostly pertain  to  changes  in  the  existing  law,  for  which
           decisions  are  to   be   taken   at   different   levels.   The
           Administration has to perform its duty within the existing  laws
           and therefore, there are a number of factors which  have  to  be
           taken into account. The Administration has  been  acquiring  the
           land for various development projects being implemented for  the
           public good. You will agree that the future of U.T.,  Chandigarh
           does not lie in agriculture. Rather, we have to concentrate  and
           invest in  those  sectors,  where  the  factor  productivity  is
           relatively higher, and which offer our youth  opportunities  for
           advancement.

                 Land is the primary  and  essential  requirement  for  any
           project and therefore the  Administration  has  to  go  for  its
           acquisition. The rate of compensation is determined as  per  the
           existing provisions of law and keeping in view the judgements of
           Hon'ble Supreme Court and High Courts. The  collector  rates  in
           Chandigarh have been revised twice, during the last year and the
           compensation has recently been paid to the tune of Rs. 40 to Rs.
           45 lacs per acre. The award is further subject to legal scrutiny
           by courts, as the land owner has the liberty to  approach  them.
           You would appreciate that the Government is not a profit  making
           organization and no  surpluses  are  being  generated  from  the
           acquisition of land. In fact, the so called surplus is the value
           addition due to the change of land use, which  is  invested  for
           the development of the U.T.  It  would  also  be  worthwhile  to
           remind you that the Administration has to incur huge expenditure
           for the creation of public utility services and a large  portion
           of the acquired land has to be  kept  vacant,  to  maintain  the
           character of the city.

                 Apart from the above, Chandigarh Housing Board  is  taking
           care of the oustees, under its scheme of 1996. There  really  is
           no scope for any discretion in the process.

                                        Yours sincerely,


                               [General (Retd.) S.F. Rodrigues
                                        PVSM, VSM].”



19.   Some of the landowners including Brig. Kuldip  Singh  Kehlon,  who  is
one of  the appellants in the appeal  arising  out  of  SLP  (C)  Nos.13518-
13521/2011 filed an application under the Right  to  Information  Act,  2005
(‘RTI’ Act) and sought  information  on  various  issues  which  had  direct
bearing on the acquisition of their land.  Senior  Town  Planner-cum-Central
Public Information  Officer,  Chandigarh  Administration  sent  reply  dated
22.7.2007, the relevant portions of which are extracted below:
           “The information of the paras relating  to  this  office  is  as
           under:-
           3 (vii) FAR Allowed in IT Park Area:
        a. Built to suit site (BTS)          1.25
        b. Campus sites                 0.5


           However, FAR can be increased to 0.75 on payment.

           4(c) The Development Plan of the area being acquired: -

           Planning for Ph.-1 and Ph.-II of Rajiv  Gandhi  Technology  Park
           has been done. However the III phase  of  Chandigarh  Technology
           Park is being acquired and planning for the same  will  be  done
           after the acquisition and on receipt of  survey  plan  from  the
           Engineering Department, U.T., Chandigarh.

           4(d) The area in question is not yet planned  hence,  detail  of
           area cannot be provided.

           4(1) THE PLANNING OF Phase I & II of the Rajiv Gandhi Technology
           Park has been completed. In the side area the planning has  been
           done for IT and other related services/uses  to  IT  Park  i.e.,
           Hotel, Grid Sub Station, Tube Wells,  Commercial  Area,  reserve
           etc.

           4(j,k)  It is a policy matter to be decided at higher level.

           5 (a) Originally the Chandigarh was planned  for  five  lacs  of
           population. As per the  2001  census  the  total  population  of
           Chandigarh is 9 lacs and it is envisaged that in the  year  2021
           the  approximate  population  of  Chandigarh  will  be  18  lacs
           approximately on the basis of growth rate projections.

           (c)  There is no legal master plan of  the  city.  However,  the
           planning of  the  land  available  within  the  jurisdiction  of
           Chandigarh is being undertaken as per  the  future  demands  and
           needs of the city.”
                                                         (emphasis supplied)



20.   The appellants and other landowners  filed  objections  under  Section
5A(1) of the Act,  the salient features of which were:
           “(a)  The purpose for which the land is proposed to be  acquired
           is not in fact 'public-purpose'.

           (b) The proposed acquisition  is  not  in  consonance  with  the
           Environment Law and proposed development will  certainly  damage
           the ecology of Sukhna Choe catchments area.

           (c) This acquisition is against the  provisions  of  the  Forest
           (Conservation) Act, 1980, which  does  not  allow  deforestation
           leading to environmental deterioration.

           (d) The Chandigarh Administration has not obtained permission of
           the Government of India for changing the land use  of  the  land
           sought to be acquired.

           (e)   The acquisition of land would  involve  chopping  down  of
           hundreds of fruit and non-fruit bearing trees of  more  than  15
           years age.

           (f) This area works as lungs to the residents of the City. After
           acquisition of this area and construction of high buildings,  no
           breathing area will left for the residents of Chandigarh.

           (g) The land is being acquired for four different purposes,  but
           the Administration itself does not know  as  to  how  much  area
           would be utilized for each and individual purpose.

           (h)  The Chandigarh Administration has acquired large chunks  of
           land over past 15 years, most of which is still lying unutilized
           or encroached. He enumerated a number of notifications issued by
           the Chandigarh Administration vide which  the  lands  have  been
           acquired by the Chandigarh Administration.

           (i)  The  land  is  being  acquired  with   the   intention   or
           profiteering.

           (j) The Chandigarh Administration has not been able to provide a
           proper plan for the development and utilization of the  land  to
           be acquired.

           (k)   The  Administration  has  not  framed   any   scheme   for
           rehabilitation of the landowners whose land is acquired and they
           have been uprooted more than once.

           (l) Only 10% of the flats would be built on 129  acres  of  land
           given to Parsvanath Developers and the developer  is  likely  to
           accrue immense tax relief on the basis of the units being  built
           in the SEZ.

           (m) Most of the land stands already acquired  and  reserved  for
           I.T Park has not so far utilized then what is the  necessity  to
           acquire this land.

           (n) Where the acquisition of this land will uproot  the  farmers
           from their livelihood and abode, it would immensely  damage  the
           green cover of the city and about 50000 fully grown trees  would
           also be chopped down. The Administration on one  hand  does  not
           allow even a tree to be cut, though it is on the mettalled  road
           in terms of Forest Act, then how the Administration would afford
           to cut the 20 years old fruit/non-fruit bearing trees.

           (o) The acquisition of land is in violation of  the  Punjab  New
           Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952.   The  Periphery  Control
           Act was enacted to ensure the outskirts of  the  city  as  green
           belt.”

21.   For the sake of reference,  some  of  the  objections  filed  by  Shri
Surinder Singh Brar and Shri Kuldip Singh Kahlon are reproduced below:

            Surinder Singh Brar:
           “Notification not proper hence liable to be quashed:
           The impugned notification is liable to be quashed as the  public
           purpose mentioned therein is vague as it is not possible for the
           right holders to raise objections against the same under section
           5-A of the Land Acquisition Act,  1894  effectively.  The  total
           area under acquisition is less than 168 acres.  There  are  four
           purposes mentioned for which the land is sought to  be  acquired
           without specifying as to  how  much  land  is  needed  for  each
           purpose. The four purposes mentioned are:

              i) the provision of city level infrastructure
             ii) the   regulated   urban   development    of   area  between
                 Chandigarh and Mani Majra
            iii) the planned development
             iv) expansion of Chandigarh Technology Park.

           The petitioner does not know as to how much area is  needed  for
           either of these purposes, what is  the  meaning  of  city  level
           infrastructure and what  is  the  difference  between  regulated
           urban development and planned development. In fact 100 acres  of
           land is not big enough an area for either  of  the  purposes  in
           itself.  Therefore,  to  enable  the  right  holders  to   raise
           objections effectively they must know as to  how  much  area  is
           required for each purpose and how  the  purposes  mentioned  are
           different from each other, particularly item numbers  (i),  (ii)
           and (iii).

           The  impugned  acquisition  proceedings  have  been   undertaken
           without the concurrence of the Defence Ministry,  Government  of
           India.   Chandigarh   is   surrounded   by   strategic   defence
           installations like the Mullapur Garibdas Air Force Station, Head
           Quarters of the Western Command at Chandimandir, Chandigarh  Air
           Force Station,  Kasauli  Air  Force  Station,  etc.  Infact  the
           Mullapur Garibdas Air Force Station houses most modern  missiles
           and radars while Chandimandir houses a  strategic  communication
           centre.  Thus,  urbanising  the  area  in  Village  Mani  Majra,
           District Chandigarh may lead to compromising with  the  security
           of the nation.

           Violation of the Periphery Act:
           The impugned notification itself is violative of the  provisions
           of the Periphery Control  Act  in  so  far  as  the  permissions
           required under the said  Act  have  not  been  obtained  by  the
           Chandigarh Administration.   The Chandigarh Administration is  a
           separate entity from the authorities exercising the powers under
           the Periphery Control Act. To the knowledge of the objectors  no
           permission has been obtained, as  of  date,  by  the  Chandigarh
           Administration for the development of  the  aforementioned  land
           from  the  authority  under  the  Periphery  Control   Act   and
           consequently the entire  acquisition  proceedings  are  illegal,
           null and void.

           Over  the  past  15  years  the  Chandigarh  Administration  has
           compulsorily acquired huge chunks of land in Village  Manimajra,
           District Chandigarh purportedly  for  various  public  purposes.
           However, in most cases the areas acquired have  not  been  fully
           utilized and are either lying vacant  or  have  been  encroached
           upon.  In  this  scenario   the   action   of   the   Chandigarh
           Administration to acquire another huge chunk of land in  Village
           Manimajra under the impugned  notification  is  incomprehensible
           and cannot be justified. The details of the notifications issued
           under Sections 4  and  6  of  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  1894
           whereunder  land  has  earlier  been  acquired   by   Chandigarh
           Administration in Village  Manimajra,  District  Chandigarh  but
           large  chunks  whereof  are  still  lying  unutilized  or  under
           encroachment are as under:

           Public purpose not defined:

           In the impugned notification the Chandigarh  Administration  has
           proposed to acquire the land for the alleged public purpose of:

                 "....the  provision  of  city  level  infrastructure,   the
                 regulated urban development of the area between  Chandigarh
                 and Mani Majra, the planned development  and  expansion  of
                 Chandigarh Technology Park" in village Manimajra.

           The setting-up or expansion of a technology park, for which  the
           land in dispute is also sought to be acquired, is not  a  public
           purpose. In  fact,  the  Chandigarh  Administration  itself  has
           neither developed nor is it running the technology park but  has
           allotted the land to DLF Ltd., a private entrepreneur  for  this
           purpose. DLF Ltd. has profiteered by selling the area further to
           other private companies. Thus the whole idea behind the impugned
           acquisition proceedings is to assist a private  entrepreneur  to
           profiteer. No person from the ordinary public will be  benefited
           in any way. In today's age and economy  a  private  entrepreneur
           can very well purchase land by private negotiations  instead  of
           the State assisting him.

           If the Chandigarh Administration is  bent  upon  urbanising  the
           green belt against all respect for the ecology and  environment,
           then why are the landowners themselves not  allowed  to  develop
           their land within the set development plan as opposed to  taking
           the land away from  the  small  agriculturists  and  selling  it
           further to private developers at a huge profit, thus playing the
           role of land brokers.

           As no real public  purpose  has  clearly  been  defined  by  the
           Chandigarh  Administration  in  the  impugned  notification  i.e
           building roads for common use etc. it is clear that  it  is  for
           the purpose  of  a  particular  industry  only.  The  Chandigarh
           Administration ought to define in clear  terms  as  to  what  it
           means by public purpose. How does a particular private  industry
           become a "public purpose".

           The purported purposes for which the land in dispute  is  sought
           to be acquired under the impugned notification are the provision
           of city level infrastructure, the regulated development  of  the
           area between Chandigarh and Manimajra, the  planned  development
           and expansion of Chandigarh Technology Park.  The  said  alleged
           public purposes  mentioned  in  the  impugned  notification  are
           extremely vague and non-specific leaving one completely  in  the
           dark as to what actually the Chandigarh  Administration  intends
           to do with the  acquired  land.  No  particular  residential  or
           commercial  scheme  has  been  drawn  up   by   the   Chandigarh
           Administration  for  acquiring  the   land   in   dispute.   The
           acquisition of valuable land  under  the  impugned  notification
           thus amounts to a colourable exercise of power by the Chandigarh
           Administration.

           Under the impugned notification the purported public purpose for
           which the land in dispute is being  acquired  is  stated  to  be
           planned and regular development as well  as  provision  of  city
           level infrastructure. It is not understandable  as  to  how  the
           same land can be developed to provide city level  infrastructure
           which  necessarily  means  urbanization.  The  concern  for  the
           ecology and environment  is  completely  necessary.  Rather  the
           acquisition  under  the  impugned  notification  would  lead  to
           complete destruction of the land sought to be acquired under the
           impugned notification.

           The  public  purpose  must  not  only  be   specified   in   the
           notification issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act,
           1894 but in order to enable an objector  to  effectively  object
           under Section 5-A the details of the public  purpose,  alongwith
           the details of the scheme, the plans etc. must be  available  in
           the office of the Land Acquisition Collector for perusal of  the
           objector.  In  the  present  case  as  no  such  plan/scheme  is
           available in the office of the Land Acquisition Collector or any
           other office, it is apparent that the alleged public purpose  is
           merely an attempt by the Chandigarh  Administration  to  acquire
           the land with the sole object of using it at a  later  date  for
           whatsoever purpose that may be required.

           No public purpose has been spelt out nor any public purpose  has
           been established for the proposed acquisition. In any  case  the
           proposed construction of the IT Park is not a conducive  measure
           because of the fact that  it  is  closer  to  the  defence  area
           adjoining Chandimandir and can interfere  in  the  communication
           system and sensitive defence installations. The  public  purpose
           mentioned is vague and as such it is not possible for the  right
           holders to raise objections against the same, under section  5-A
           of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 effectively.

           Violation of Environmental and Forest Laws:

           The land in dispute  is  very  close  to  the  Sukhna  Lake  and
           adjacent to the Sukhna Choe and the area declared as a  reserved
           forest. If the land in dispute and  its  surrounding  areas  are
           allowed to be urbanised it will result in the degradation of the
           habitat and disturb the thousands of migratory birds which  come
           every year to the Sukhna Lake. It may be mentioned here that the
           Sukhna Lake is a wetland declared by the Central Government  and
           is a  protected  area  and  is  known  as  the  Sukhna  Wildlife
           Sanctuary. If high rise buildings are allowed to be  constructed
           on the land being acquired under the  impugned  notification  it
           will affect the migratory route of the thousands of birds  which
           make their nests in the Sukhna Lake area after migrating from as
           far as Siberia in Russia. Permitting urbanisation  next  to  the
           Sukhna Lake and next to the surrounding reserve forest will be a
           death knell for the precious wildlife and fauna existing  there.
           Though  trees  may  be  able  to  survive   the   onslaught   of
           urbanisation, wild animals and birds certainly will not be  able
           to do so and they would have to move to safer habitats away from
           human habitation.

           It would also be pertinent to mention here that the land  sought
           to be acquired is forest land as  also  agricultural  land.  The
           proposed acquisition will result in the extinction, uprooting  &
           leveling of these trees which are in  the  prime  of  life.  The
           proposed  acquisition  is   violative   of   the   climate   and
           environmental laws.

           The acquisition of the land in dispute  would  involve  chopping
           down of fruit bearing trees and non fruit bearing  trees.  Under
           the provisions of the Forest Act no tree in  Chandigarh  can  be
           cut without permission of the Central Government.  In  case  the
           Central Government decides not to grant the  permission  to  the
           Chandigarh Administration to chop down  trees  standing  on  the
           land in dispute, the entire acquisition proceedings would end up
           in a nullity with wastage of huge sums of money and man-hours.

           The land sought to be acquired under the  impugned  notification
           is basically agricultural land on which, apart from crops, there
           are hundreds of fruit bearing trees and non-fruit bearing  trees
           standing.  This  green  area  acts  as  a  barrier  between  the
           urbanized areas in Chandigarh and  Panchkula  in  Haryana.  This
           green and forested area also helps in stopping soil erosion into
           the Sukhna Choe. The removal of this  green  and  forested  area
           would result in soil erosion which is like to cause flash floods
           in  the  rainy  season  thus  putting  in  danger  the  city  of
           Chandigarh itself. As  such  the  dangers  to  the  ecology  and
           subsequently to the city itself can  well  be  imagined  if  the
           acquisition under the impugned notification is allowed to stand.
           The havoc caused along the banks of the choe and in the  village
           of Kishangarh in particular during the recent  rainy  season  is
           not something to be taken lightly.  With  the  urbanization  and
           choking of Sukhna Choe/Lake  catchment  area  Chandigarh  itself
           will be liable to immense danger of floods  which  can  be  life
           threatening to its citizen as we have seen in the  recent  past.
           The Chandigarh Administration needs to define its role viz a viz
           the citizen, is it here to protect us or to endanger our  lives.
           Chandigarh needs to be protected and that is what the Chandigarh
           Administration should be doing.

           That in any case, no resolution for change has been  passed  for
           conversion of the proposed land from the zoning  area  which  is
           forest land area/green belt prior to the date of the publication
           of the notice. Thus the notification is vitiated on this  ground
           alone.

           The proposed acquisition will also disturb the ecological plants
           and flora and fauna of the area because the proposed acquisition
           will also disturb the dense forest area having more than  50,000
           grown trees which are  more  than  30  years  old.  Forests  and
           orchards are the lungs of a  city  and  have  a  very  important
           environmental function to perform. Such lands cannot be acquired
           under the provisions of Land Acquisition Act, 1894.

           The  Chandigarh  Administration   has   not   carried   out   an
           Environmental  Impact  Assessment  study  which   is   extremely
           necessary before an exercise of this magnitude is  carried  out.
           Further more it needs to be  pointed  out  that  if  the  recent
           happenings in the country are any indication, it is essential to
           carry out a geological study of the  area  and  conduct  surveys
           before deciding to demolish the  green  belt  around  Chandigarh
           which the Chandigarh Administration has not  done.  Every  place
           cannot be suitable for the multi-storied monsters of  steel  and
           concrete that are bound to come up on the  land  once  acquired.
           Nature  is  beautiful  but  it  does  demand  obedience  to  its
           ordinances.  When  violated  the  earth  erupts  and   we   have
           earthquakes. Man cannot continue to 'pick nature's  pocket'.  He
           must discipline himself.

           No Planning/Scheme exists and Discrimination:

           The impugned notification is illegal and void in as much  as  no
           plans are available  in  the  office  of  the  Land  Acquisition
           Collector with respect to the alleged city level  infrastructure
           to be set up. There is no plan available for the  protection  of
           the ecology and environment and for setting up/expansion of  the
           Chandigarh Technology Park.

           The petitioner reserve their rights to file such  objections  as
           and when these plans are made available.

           On enquiry, the petitioner was informed that no  the  plans  for
           the Chandigarh Technology Park and the scheme for protection  of
           ecology and environment of Sukhna Choe Watershed  was  available
           in  the  office   of   the   Land   Acquisition   Collector.   A
           representative of the petitioner was informed by the  office  of
           the    Chief    Architect    that    none    of    the     above
           particulars/scheme/site plans were available with them  as  none
           have been framed/drawn up by the Chandigarh  Administration  nor
           is relevant urban planning data available. It is  thus  apparent
           that in the absence of any detail plans and data with respect to
           the avowed public purpose, the alleged public purpose is a  mere
           sham and, therefore, violates the rights of  the  petitioner  to
           effectively object to  the  proposed  acquisition  in  terms  of
           Section 5-A of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. Consequently  the
           entire proceedings are illegal, null and void.

           The Chandigarh Administration has not even designated a planning
           agency that could have shown how the area under  acquisition  is
           to be developed and utilized. The Chandigarh Administration  has
           not been able to produce a proper plan for  the  development  of
           the so-called Technology Park. No consideration  seems  to  have
           been taken of the following points:

           a) geographical features that is physiography,  climate,  water,
              soils and other physical resources;
           b) means of communication and accessibility;
           c) distribution of the present and future population;
           d) industrial location and growth trends;
           e) economic base and commercial activities;
           f) preservation of historical and cultural heritage;
           g) urban expansion and periphery management;
           h) ecological and environmental balance;
           i) balanced regional development of the City Beautiful;
           j) dispersal of economic activities to alleviate pressure on the
              city.

           It is clear that no such plan existed at the  time  issuance  of
           the impugned notification and therefore the petitioner have been
           denied a basic right of examining the plans and other  documents
           asked for.”




            Kuldip Singh Kahlon:
           “VIOLATION OF PERIPHERY CONTROL ACT:

           The land in question falls within the  periphery  of  Chandigarh
           and the Periphery Control  Act,  1951  regulates  its  use.  The
           purpose of this legislation is to prohibit any activity that  is
           non-agricultural  and  to  that  extent   even   prohibits   the
           landowners from constructing houses for their own living. The UT
           Administration, has been forcefully implementing  this  Act  and
           penalizing those who violate any of its provisions.

           The  provisions  of  the  Periphery  Control  Act  cannot  apply
           differently for the public and differently  the  Administration.
           This would be arbitrary and discriminatory and be  violative  of
           all settled principles and tenets of law. The public purpose for
           which the land is being acquired is not covered or permitted  by
           the periphery control act, and therefore,  the  notification  is
           void ab initio. The State cannot be the violator of its own laws
           to the detriment of the public. The notification deserves to  be
           withdrawn on this account alone.

           MARKET  VALUE,  MAKING  UNDUE  AND  ILLEGAL  PROFIT  BY  THE  UT
           ADMINISTRTION/ITS AGENCIES:

           The sole purpose of the Administration appears to be is  to  use
           public funds to acquire land and sell it at  high  profits.  The
           market value of land is artificially suppressed  by  disallowing
           any activity, other than agriculture, by the UT  Administration.
           The market forces are not allowed to operate so long as land  is
           in the hands of the landowners.

           The Collector Tate therefore cannot and  does  not  reflect  the
           market value of the land. This situation changes when  the  land
           is in the hands of the UT Administration or its  Agencies,  This
           is proved from the fact  that  129  acres  of  land  in  village
           Manimajra was acquired in the year 2002 and compensation between
           Rs. 9-12 lacs per acre was paid by the  UT  Administration.  The
           same was transferred to Chandigarh Housing  Board  at  no  cost,
           which further sold at profit to  developers  namely:  Parsvanath
           Developer Private Limited for a sum  of  Rs.  821.21  crores  or
           approx. 630 lacs per acre. This is approximately  70  times  the
           collector's rate.

           It is important to note that undeveloped land was sold  to  this
           company, which means that the UT Administration acquired land at
           low price and without making any investment on it sold it  at  a
           higher profit. This is extremely unfair to the farmers who  have
           struggled rate does not reflect a realistic/actual value of  the
           land, in this area. Going  by  the  sale  mentioned  above,  the
           market value of the land in village Manimajra is not  less  than
           Rs.630 lacs per acre.

           VIOLATION OF MASTER PLAN:

           The development of Chandigarh is regulated by its  Master  plan.
           The land proposed to  be  acquired  falls  in  the  ecologically
           fragile green belt along the lake and Sukhna choe. Any land  use
           change will not only threaten the environment of  the  city  but
           will also disturb the habitat of a large species of  flora  arid
           fauna. It is public knowledge that no lay out plan for this area
           has been neither prepared nor  other  formalities  completed  as
           mandated by the land acquisition Act and the FCs Standing  Order
           28. Acquisition of land without first amending the  master  Plan
           by  following  due  procedure  prescribed  by  law  and  without
           clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests  will  be
           bad in law.”

22.   The LAO heard the objectors, briefly noticed the  substance  of  their
objections but did not deal with any one  of  them  and  submitted  separate
reports in relation to the two notifications  with  identical  observations,
which are extracted below:

                            “OBSERVATIONS:

           After seeing the revenue record and spot inspection, I  find  no
           merits in the objections raised by the Objectors.  Because,  for
           the future extension of the Capital  and  to  ensure  healthy  &
           planned development, and further, to prevent growth of slums and
           ramshackle construction on the land lying on  the  periphery  of
           the 'new city', area of 10 miles on all  sides  from  the  outer
           boundary of the land was declared as 'controlled area'. In order
           to have legal authority to control and regulate the use  of  the
           land, the Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act was enacted
           in 1952. The structures as existed on the  site  called  Shastri
           Nagar have been raised in violation of the  Punjab  New  Capital
           (Periphery)  Control  Act,   1952.   The   Capital   of   Punjab
           (Development and  Regulation)  Act,  1952  and  the  Punjab  New
           Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952 (two  Acts  governing  the
           planning and development of UT, Chandigarh) envisaged Chandigarh
           as  urbanized  town  or  capital  city   in   which   ramshackle
           construction is antithetical to the very concept and planning of
           Chandigarh. This is clear from  the  Statement  of  Objects  and
           Reasons and Section 1(2) of the latter act which are  reproduced
           hereunder for ready reference that whole of the area of  UT  was
           part of 'Capital Project'  and  was  kept  reserved  for  future
           expansion to be required and acquired: -

                "Statement of Objects and Reasons.-  The  Punjab  Government
                are constructing  a  New  Capital  named  "Chandigarh".  The
                master plan  providing  for  the  future  extension  of  the
                Capital will extend over a much greater area than  the  area
                acquired so far the construction of the first phase  of  the
                Capital. To ensure healthy and planned  development  of  the
                new city it is necessary to  prevent  growth  of  slums  and
                ramshackle construction on the land lying on  the  periphery
                of the new city. To achieve this object it is  necessary  to
                have legal authority to regulate the use of  the  said  land
                for purposes other than the purposes for which it is used at
                present."

                1(2) It extends to that area of the State of Punjab which is
                adjacent to and is within a distance of  ten  miles  on  all
                sides from the outer boundary of the land acquired  for  the
                Capital of the State at Chandigarh as that Capital and State
                existed immediately before the 1st November, 1966."
                "5. Restrictions in a controlled area. - Except as  provided
                hereinafter, no person shall erect any building or  make  or
                extend any excavation, or lay out any means of access  to  a
                road, in the controlled area save  in  accordance  with  the
                plans and restrictions and with the previous  permission  of
                the Deputy Commissioner in writing.”




           His Excellency the Governor of  Punjab  and  Administrator,  UT,
           Chandigarh has already conveyed his version, vide  letter  dated
           31.07.2006 to one of the Objector - Sh. S.S. Brar,  IPS  (Retd.)
           that the Administration has been acquiring the land for  various
           development projects being implemented for the public  good.  He
           further  emphasized  that  the  future   of   Union   Territory,
           Chandigarh  does  not  lie  in  agriculture,  but  we  have   to
           concentrate and  invest  in  those  sectors,  where  the  factor
           productivity is relatively higher, and, which  offer  our  youth
           opportunities for advancement. For  that  matter,  the  land  is
           primary  and  essential  requirement  for   any   project,   and
           therefore, the Administration has to go for its acquisition.

           The objection that the Administration has made huge profits  out
           of land acquisition is baseless. The  rate  of  compensation  is
           determined  as  per  the  existing  provisions   of   law,   The
           determination of compensation of land is based on a  very  sound
           principle of average as enunciated and  upheld  by  the  Hon'ble
           Supreme Court  in  various  judgements  as  a  sound  basis  for
           calculating market value. The Collector rates  for  agricultural
           land have been revised twice in the last year.  While  acquiring
           the land, the land owners are not only paid the award calculated
           on the basis of Collector's rate, but  solatium  @  30%  on  the
           value assessed on the basis of Collector's rate  and  additional
           market-value @ 12% per annum on the value assessed on the  basis
           of Collector's rates is also paid through the award. It is worth
           mentioning that the same parameters  are  being  followed  while
           making the assessment of compensation in the other  states  also
           in the country. The award is further subject to  legal  scrutiny
           by courts, as the land owner has the liberty to approach them.

           The Administration is not a profit-making  organization  and  no
           surpluses are being generated from acquisition or  from  further
           allotment of land. In fact, lot of funds  are  spent  on  public
           utility  services  like  water-supply,  sewerage,   electricity-
           supply,  laying  of  roads,  power-plants,   welfare-activities,
           public  amenities,  public-toilets,  dumping-grounds,  sewerage-
           treatment   plants,   Educational    Institutions,    Hospitals,
           Electricity Grid Station, Tubewell and Community  Centres,  etc.
           Some land  is  allotted  at  subsidized  rates  also  in  public
           interest  for  religious,  charitable,   community/institutional
           purposes and for rehabilitation of slum-dwellers.”





 23.  Thereafter, the office  of  the  Finance  Secretary  prepared  a  note
incorporating therein the observations of the  LAO.  The  Finance  Secretary
recorded his comments and the Adviser appended his signature signifying  his
approval to the recommendations of the LAO. For the sake of  reference,  the
office note and the comments of the Finance Secretary are reproduced  below:

       “Subject: Report u/s 5-A for acquisition  of  land  measuring  104.83
                 acres in Manimajra – Notification u/s 6.

             The  Land  Acquisition  Officer  has   requested   to   accord
       Administrative  approval  for  the  issuance  of  notification  Under
       Section of the Land Acquisition Act and also for  the  acceptance  of
       recommendations after receiving objections Under Section 5 A from the
       Land Owner with regard to acquisition  land  measuring  104.83  acres
       acquisition of land for the purpose namely  "the  provision  of  city
       level infrastructure, the regulated urban  development  of  the  area
       between  Chandigarh  and  Manimajra:  the  planned  development   and
       expansion to Chandigarh Technology Park in  Village  Manimajra,  U.T.
       Chandigarh.

            The Administration had issued notification Under Section  4  of
       the Act for the  acquisition  of  said  land.  The  Land  Acquisition
       Officer has invited objections and sixteen land  owners  have  filled
       their objections.

            Sh. P.C. Dhiman appeared on behalf of some land owners  objected
       to the acquisition of land on the ground that there are large  number
       of fruit bearing trees on the agriculture land. The  illiterate  land
       owners have only the sole mode for their livelihood. Most of the land
       acquired by the administration earlier has not been utilized. It  has
       further been objected that emaciate compensation is  being  given  to
       the land owners whereas the slum dwellers occupying  government  land
       are being rehabilitated and the land owners are being made home less.
       The Administration is acquiring  land  for  the  public  purpose  for
       pocketing hefty profits by giving the land to private developers.  No
       rehabilitation scheme for the land owners have been framed.

            Some other land owners have also raised the similar objections.
       Mrs. Ritu Joshi objected that the land is  being  acquired  is  being
       given for the commercial activities whereas, she  has  not  permitted
       the land for the hotel project when she applied once.

            The Land Acquisition  Officer  after  examining  objections  has
       found no merits, because for  future  extension  of  capital  and  to
       ensure healthy and planned development and further to prevent  growth
       of slums, this was required to  be  acquired.  The  Land  Acquisition
       Officer has further stated that the structure existing  on  the  site
       called Shastri Nagar has been raised in violation  of  the  periphery
       control act. The objection that the Administration is  paying  meager
       compensation is baseless as reported by the Land Acquisition Officer.
       The compensation is determined as per the existing provision  of  the
       law. The landowners are not only paid  to  award  calculated  on  the
       basis of the collector rate but also solatium @ of 30% and additional
       market value @ rate of 12 % per annum. The award has further  subject
       to the legal scrutiny by courts, as the land owners has  the  liberty
       to approach them.

            The Administration is not a profit-making organization  and  no
       surpluses are  being  generated  from  acquisition  or  from  further
       allotment of land. In fact, lot of funds are spent on public  utility
       services like water-supply, sewerage, electricity-supply,  laying  of
       roads, power-plants, welfare-activities,  public  amenities,  public-
       toilets,  dumping-grounds,   sewerage-treatment   plants,   Education
       Institutions, Hospitals, Electricity  Grid  Station,  Tube  well  and
       Community Centers etc. some land is allotted at subsidized rates also
       in public interest for religious, charitable, community/institutional
       purposes  and  for  rehabilitation  of  slum-dwellers.   As   regards
       rehabilitation of  landowners  is  concerned,  though,  there  is  no
       provision in the land  Acquisition  Act  to  provide  houses  to  the
       villagers whose land has been acquired, but  the  Chandigarh  Housing
       Board is taking care of such Oustees under the  Chandigarh  Allotment
       of Dwelling Units to the Oustees of Chandigarh Scheme, 1996.

            Keeping  in  view  the  recommendations  made   by   the   Land
       Acquisition Officer after receiving objections Under Section 5- A for
       the acquiring land measuring 104.83 acres in village Manimajra may be
       accepted and the case  may  kindly  be  sent  the  AA  for  according
       approval and issuance of notification under Section 6 is added  below
       at flag ‘Y’.

            Submitted for order please.”




       “Subject: Land Acquisition  Case: Village  Manimajra, Hadbast No.375,
                 Union Territory, Chandigarh.

            Reference PUC, the Land Acquisition Officer has  sent  a  report
       under section 5-A for acquiring land in the revenue estate of Village
       Manimajra for public purposes namely "the  provision  of  city  level
       infrastructure, the regulated urban development of the  area  between
       Chandigarh and Manimajra, the planned development  and  expansion  of
       Chandigarh Technology Park". This acquisition is for the Phase III of
       the Rajiv Gandhi Technology Park.

           In this case, the  notification  for  acquiring  land  measuring
       104.83 acres under section  4  was  issued  on  27.6.2006.  The  Land
       Acquisition Officer invited objections from land owners.  16  persons
       filed their objections in all.

           The  Land  Acquisition  Officer  heard  the  pleadings  of   the
       objectors/their counsels. The gist of their pleadings have been cited
       by the LAO from pages 412-415 of his report (PUC).

           The findings of the LAO in respect of each set of objections can
       be read at pages 416-418 of his report. The LAO has found  no  merits
       in the objections of the land-owners (objectors). The LAO  has  filed
       the objections as being devoid of merit and has  finally  recommended
       that the land notified under section 4 be acquired.

           On examination of these reports, it  is  found  that  the  LAO's
       findings are in order. Therefore, approval  may  be  granted  to  the
       proposal to issue a notification under section 6 (placed at flag ‘Y’)
       in respect of land  measuring  104.83  acres  in  Village  Manimajra,
       Hadbast No.375, U.T., Chandigarh.

           A.A.'s approval would be required in this case.

                                     28.2.2007”


24.   On the same day, the  declarations  issued  under  Section  6(1)  were
published in official gazette dated  28.2.2007,  the  relevant  portions  of
which are extracted below:

           “Whereas it  appears  to  the  Administrator,  Union  Territory,
           Chandigarh that the land in  the  locality  specified  below  is
           likely to be needed for a public purpose & namely "the provision
           of city level infrastructure, the regulated urban development of
           the  area  between  Chandigarh   and   Manimajra   the   planned
           development and  expansion  of  Chandigarh  Technology  Park  in
           Village Manimajra, H. B. No. 375, Union  Territory,  Chandigarh.
           Now, therefore, this declaration is made under the provision  of
           Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and  with  Govt.  of
           India, Ministry of Home affairs. Notification No. SO 3612  dated
           8th October, 1968 informing all to whom it may concern that  the
           land mentioned in the specifications noted below is  needed  for
           the  above  mentioned  public  purpose.  The  Land   Acquisition
           Collector Chandigarh is hereby directed to take  further  action
           for the acquisition of the said land under Section 7 of the Land
           Acquisition Act, 1894.

           The plans of the land may be inspected in  the  office  of  Land
           Acquisition Collector, UT, Chandigarh.”

                                                         (emphasis supplied)


25.    The  appellants  challenged  the  acquisition  proceedings  in   Writ
Petition  No.5065/2007  and  batch  and  prayed  that  Notifications   dated
26.6.2006, 2.8.2006  and  28.2.2007  be  quashed.   They  pleaded  that  the
acquisition of their land was vitiated due to violation of  the  mandate  of
Sections 4, 5A and 6 of the Act inasmuch as in the garb  of  acquiring  land
for a  public  purpose,  the  Chandigarh  Administration  wanted  to  favour
private developers; that the purpose specified in the  notifications  issued
under Section 4(1) was vague and on that account they could not  effectively
avail the opportunity of filing objections under  Section  5A(1);  that  the
objections filed by them were not considered by the LAO  and  the  competent
authority and the  declarations  under  Section  6(1)  were  issued  without
application of mind; that the acquisition was vitiated  because  the  matter
was not considered by  the  committee  constituted  under  the  notification
issued by the Government of India under  Section  3(3)  of  the  Environment
(Protection) Act, 1986 (for short, ‘the 1986 Act’)  and  Rule  5(3)  of  the
Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 (for short, ‘the 1986 Rules’).

26.   The Division Bench of the High Court  relied  upon  the  judgments  of
this Court in Aflatoon v. Lt. Governor of Delhi (1975)  4  SCC  285,  Gandhi
Grah Nirman Sahkari Samiti Ltd. v. State of  Rajasthan  (1993)  2  SCC  662,
State of T.N. v. L. Krishnan (1996) 1 SCC  250,  Ajay  Krishan  Shinghal  v.
Union of India (1996) 10 SCC 721  and  Sooraram  Pratap  Reddy  v.  District
Collector, Ranga Reddy District (2008) 9 SCC 552 and held  that  the  public
purpose specified in Notifications dated  26.6.2006  and  2.8.2006  was  not
vague; that the Chandigarh Administration had complied with  the  provisions
of Sections 4, 5A and 6(1) of the Act; that  the  existence  of  a  definite
plan was not a condition precedent for the acquisition  of  land;  that  the
landowners had been given  opportunity  to  file  objections  and  that  the
declaration was issued after considering  the  same.  The  High  Court  also
referred to the judgments of this Court in Somawanti v. State of Punjab  AIR
1963 SC 151 and Ganga Bishnu Swaika v. Calcutta Pinjrapole Society AIR  1968
SC 615  and  held  that  the  declaration  issued  under  Section  6(1)  was
conclusive and was not open to judicial review. The High Court further  held
that the special audit got conducted by  the  Government  of  India  in  the
context of the acquisition of land for Phases I and II of the  IT  Park  did
not have any bearing on the acquisition of land  for  Phase  III;  that  the
decision taken by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India  to  put
the  acquisition  proceedings  on  hold  did  not   adversely   affect   the
declaration issued under Section 6(1) because final decision in  the  matter
was required to be taken by the Chandigarh Administration and  further  that
non-compliance of the National Rehabilitation Policy was inconsequential.

27.    Shri  Rakesh  Dwivedi,  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for  the
appellants Surinder Singh Brar and others, relied  upon  Notification  dated
14.8.1989 issued under Article 239(1) of the Constitution to show  that  the
power vested in the appropriate Government under Sections 4(1) and  6(1)  of
the Act, which is exercisable by the President  in  relation  to  the  Union
Territories was delegated to  the  Administrator  and  argued  that  in  the
absence of delegation of power to the Adviser by the President,  the  latter
could  not  have  sanctioned  the  impugned  acquisition  by  approving  the
recommendations of the LAO.  Learned senior counsel emphasized that in  view
of Notification dated  14.8.1989,  only  the  Administrator  could  exercise
powers under the Act and that too subject to the control  of  the  President
and no other authority  could  have  exercised  that  power.   Shri  Dwivedi
further argued that the declaration issued under Section  6(1),  is  not  in
consonance with the plain language of the section because even  the  Adviser
did not consider the reports submitted by the LAO under Section 5A(2)  along
with the record of proceedings and did not record his satisfaction that  the
land was needed for a public  purpose.   Learned  senior  counsel  submitted
that use of the expressions ‘it appears’ and ‘likely to be  needed’  in  the
notifications issued on 20.8.2007 show  that  the  Adviser,  whose  approval
preceded the issuance of declaration under Section  6(1),  had  not  applied
mind to the reports of the LAO.   Shri Dwivedi then argued that the  reports
prepared by the LAO are vitiated due to non-application of mind  because  he
did not objectively consider the objections filed under  Section  5A(1)  and
mechanically made recommendations for the acquisition of land for Phase  III
ignoring that about half  of  the  land  acquired  for  Phase  II  had  been
alienated to the private developers, namely, Parsvnath Developer and  Kujjal
Builders  to  enable  them  to  construct  residential  complex  and   hotel
respectively which had nothing to do with the public  purpose  specified  in
the notifications issued under  Sections  4(1)  and  6(1).   Learned  senior
counsel further argued that the existence of a plan is sine qua non for  the
acquisition of land for planned development of the area  between  Chandigarh
and Mani Majra and expansion of IT Park and, in the absence  of  a  definite
plan, there was no justification  to  acquire  the  land  in  question.   He
sought support for this argument from the reply given by the Central  Public
Information Officer to Brig Kuldip Singh Kehlon and  pointed  out  that  the
Chandigarh Administration was  not  following  the  “Chandigarh  Inter-State
Capital Regional Plan, 2001” approved by the Coordination Committee  set  up
by the Ministry of Urban Development in 1984. Learned  senior  counsel  also
referred to the findings recorded in the Special Audit Report and  the  One-
Man Committee headed by Shri Arun Ramanathan, which  was  appointed  by  the
Government of India, to show that the land acquired for Phases I and  II  of
IT Park had not been utilized and submitted that there is  no  justification
whatsoever for the acquisition of additional land.

28.   Shri Dinesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel appearing for  some  other
appellants, pointed out that general delegation of power  by  the  President
to the Administrator vide Notification dated 1.11.1966 issued under  Article
239(1)  of  the  Constitution  stood  superseded  by   Notifications   dated
8.10.1968, 1.1.1970 and 14.8.1989 insofar as the  exercise  of  power  under
the Act is concerned and the Adviser, to whom the powers were  delegated  by
the Administrator under Section 3 of the Chandigarh (Delegation  of  Powers)
Act, 1987 (for short, ‘the 1987 Act’), was  not  entitled  to  exercise  the
power vested in the appropriate Government under Sections 4(1) and  6(1)  of
the Act.

29.   Shri Shekhar Naphade, learned senior  counsel  who  appeared  for  the
appellants  in  the  appeals  arising  out   of   SLP(C)Nos.13518-13521/2011
referred to the objections filed by his clients under Section 5A(1)  of  the
Act and argued that the High Court committed serious error  by  refusing  to
quash   the   acquisition   proceedings   ignoring   that   the   Chandigarh
Administration had  not  sought  clearance  from  the  designated  committee
constituted under Notifications dated 27.1.1994 and 14.9.2006  issued  under
Section 3(3) of the 1986 Act read with Rule 5(3) of  the  1986  Rules.  Shri
Naphade relied upon the judgment  of  this  Court  in  Karnataka  Industrial
Areas Development Board v. C. Kenchappa, (2006) 6 SCC 371  and  argued  that
non-consideration  of  the  appellants’  plea  that  the  acquisition  would
adversely impact the environment and ecology of the area is  sufficient  for
quashing the notifications impugned in the writ  petitions.  Learned  senior
counsel submitted that the satisfaction envisaged in  Section  6(1)  of  the
Act pre-supposes that ‘the appropriate Government’  has  taken  an  informed
decision after due application of mind  to  the  record  and  was  satisfied
about the need of the land for a public purpose  and  in  these  cases,  the
competent authority had not at all applied mind to the recommendations  made
by the LAO and the objections filed by the landowners.

30.   Shri Neeraj Jain, learned senior counsel argued that  the  High  Court
committed serious  error  by  negating  the  appellants’  challenge  to  the
acquisition of their land ignoring its impact on  the  environment  and  the
fact that the declaration  under  Section  6  could  not  have  been  issued
without objectively  considering  this  important  aspect.   Learned  senior
counsel also highlighted that a major chunk of the land acquired  for  Phase
II had been transferred to the developers  for  residential  and  commercial
purposes and argued that there was no justification for the  acquisition  of
additional land in the name of expanding the IT Park.

31.   Learned counsel appearing for the  other  appellants  largely  adopted
the arguments of Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, Shri Dinesh Dwivedi and  Shri  Shekhar
Naphade and submitted that the entire acquisition should be quashed  because
the functionaries of the Chandigarh Administration did  not  apply  mind  to
the relevant issues including adverse  impact  of  the  acquisition  on  the
environment and ecology of the area.

32.   Shri Rakesh Khanna, learned  Additional  Solicitor  General,  produced
copy of Notification dated 8.10.1968 issued  under  Article  239(1)  of  the
Constitution and xerox copies of the notings recorded  by  the  officers  of
the Ministry of Home Affairs on the report prepared by the  Inquiry  Officer
in the light of the Special Audit Report.  He  also  produced  the  decision
taken by the Home Minister on 23.9.2010, which reads as under:

           “I have seen the notes as well as the final  recommendations  of
           AS(CS) on pages 31 and 32/n. I am in broad  agreement  with  the
           recommendations on pages 31 and 32/n subject to the following:

           (i) If  any  Advisory  is  required  to  be  issued  to  the  UT
           Administration, a draft of the Advisory may  be  put  up  to  me
           first through HS.

           (ii) Where  the  Inquiry  Officer  has  agreed  with  the  audit
           findings, they may be reduced to the form of a preliminary  show
           cause notice and the preliminary show cause notice may be issued
           to those who have been found, prima facie, responsible  and  the
           comments obtained on why disciplinary proceedings and such other
           action as permissible under law  should  not  be  taken  against
           them. The show cause notice  may  be  drawn  up  and  issued  by
           30.9.2010 and they may be given time until 15.10.2010  to  reply
           to the preliminary show cause notices.

           (iii) Where the IO has not  agreed  with  the  findings  of  the
           audit, they may be referred to the CCA(H) for his comments. This
           may be done by 30.9.2010 and the  CCA(H)  may  be  requested  to
           offer his comments by 15.10.2010.

           (iv)  Any review of the powers delegated to the Administrator of
           Chandigarh  may  be  done  only   in   consultation   with   the
           Administrator. The proposals may be put up to me  first  through
           HS and then I shall give directions  on  how  the  Administrator
           should be consulted.

           (v) The Inquiry Report may also be forwarded to the CVC for such
           action as CVC may deem fit.”



33.   Dr. Rajeev Dhawan, learned senior  counsel  appearing  for  the  Union
Territory of Chandigarh relied upon Notification dated  1.11.1966  by  which
the President conferred the powers and functions  of  the  State  Government
upon  the  Administrator  and  Notification  dated  25.2.1988  issued  under
Section 3(1) of the 1987 Act vide  which  the  Administrator  delegated  the
powers vested in him under various State laws  to  the  Adviser  and  argued
that the impugned acquisition  cannot be nullified on the  ground  that  the
notifications under Sections 4(1) and 6(1) were issued without the  approval
of  the  Administrator.   Dr.  Dhawan  submitted  that   the   notifications
challenged before the High Court cannot be declared illegal  on  the  ground
that the Administrator had not accorded sanction to the acquisition of  land
for Phase III of IT Park because no such point was argued on behalf  of  the
appellants. He then submitted that  the  Advisor  to  the  Administrator  is
equivalent to the Chief Commissioner and  the  Chief  Commissioner  and  the
Administrator of a Union Territory are of coordinate rank.   Learned  senior
counsel then argued that the acquisition of the appellants’ land  cannot  be
quashed on the ground that the  purpose  specified  in  Notifications  dated
26.6.2006 and 2.8.2006 was not a public purpose or that the same was  vague.
He submitted that the appellants cannot  make  a  complaint  on  this  score
because they had filed detailed objections under Section 5A(1),  which  were
duly considered by the LAO.  Dr.  Dhawan  emphasised  that  the  declaration
issued under Section 6(1) is in consonance with the language of the  statute
and argued that the High Court did not  commit  any  error  by  refusing  to
quash Notifications dated 28.2.2007 on the ground that  in  the  first  part
thereof  the  satisfaction  of  the  appropriate  Government  has  not  been
recorded.  Learned senior counsel further argued that  the  existence  of  a
master plan or lay-out plan is not sine qua non for the acquisition of  land
because the purposes specified in Section 4(1) notification were  identified
public purposes. He  pointed  out  that  substantial  portion  of  the  land
acquired for Phase I and Phase II  of  IT  Park  had  been  allotted  to  IT
industries and the remaining portion was used for roads,  parks,  etc.,  and
argued that the cancellation of allotment of three IT companies cannot  lead
to  an  inference  that  the  acquired  land  has  not  been  utilised   for
development of IT Park. In the end, Dr.  Dhawan  argued  that  the  findings
recorded by the Special Audit Team and the One-Man Committee cannot be  made
basis for quashing the acquisition of land for Phase III  of  IT  Park.   In
support of his arguments, learned senior counsel relied upon  the  judgments
in Somawanti v. State of Punjab (supra), Ganga  Bishnu  Swaika  v.  Calcutta
Pinjrapole Society (supra), Aflatoon  v.  Lt.  Governor  of  Delhi  (supra),
Gandhi Grah Nirman Sahkari Samiti Ltd. v. State of Rajasthan (supra),  State
of T.N. v. L. Krishnan (supra) and Ajay Krishan Shinghal v. Union  of  India
(supra).

34.   We  have  given  serious  thought  to  the  respective  arguments  and
carefully scrutinized the record of these petitions as also the  files  made
available  by  Shri  Sudhir  Walia,  learned  counsel  for  the   Chandigarh
Administration.

 35.  We shall first consider  the  question  whether  the  Advisor  to  the
 Administrator had the  jurisdiction  to  approve  the  acquisition  of  the
 appellants’ land. For deciding this question, it will be useful  to  notice
 the provisions of Article 239 of the Constitution (amended  and  unamended)
 and the notifications issued under that Article. The same read as under:

38.   The unamended Article  239  envisaged  administration  of  the  States
specified in Part C of  the  First  Schedule  of  the  Constitution  by  the
President through a Chief  Commissioner  or  a  Lieutenant  Governor  to  be
appointed by him or through the Government of a  neighbouring  State.   This
was subject to other provisions  of  Part  VIII  of  the  Constitution.   As
against this, amended Article 239 lays down that subject to any law  enacted
by Parliament every Union Territory shall be administered by  the  President
acting through an Administrator appointed by him with  such  designation  as
he may specify. In terms  of  Clause  (2)  of  Article  239  (amended),  the
President can appoint the Governor of a State  as  an  Administrator  of  an
adjoining Union territory and on his appointment, the Governor  is  required
to exercise his function as an Administrator independently  of  his  Council
of Ministers. The difference in the language of the  unamended  and  amended
Article 239 makes it clear that prior  to  1.11.1956,  the  President  could
administer Part C  State  through  a  Chief  Commissioner  or  a  Lieutenant
Governor, but, after the amendment, every Union Territory is required to  be
administered by the President through  an  Administrator  appointed  by  him
with such designation as he may specify.  In terms of Clause  2  of  Article
239 (amended), the President is empowered to appoint the Governor  of  State
as the Administrator to an adjoining Union  Territory  and  once  appointed,
the Governor, in his capacity as Administrator, has to act independently  of
the Council of Ministers of the State of which he is the Governor.

39.    A reading of the Notification  issued  on  1.11.1966  shows  that  in
exercise of the power vested in him  under  Article  239(1),  the  President
directed that the Administrator shall exercise the power and  discharge  the
functions of the State  Government  under  the  laws  which  were  in  force
immediately before formation of the Union  Territory  of  Chandigarh.   This
was subject to the President’s own control and  until  further  orders.   By
another notification issued on the same day,  the  President  directed  that
all orders and other instruments made and executed in the name of the  Chief
Commissioner of Union Territory of Chandigarh shall be authenticated by  the
signatures of the specified officers.  These notifications  clearly  brought
out the distinction between the position of the Administrator and the  Chief
Commissioner insofar as the Union Territory  of  Chandigarh  was  concerned.
Subsequently,  the  President  appointed   the   Governor   of   Punjab   as
Administrator  of  the  Union   Territory   of   Chandigarh   and   separate
notifications were issued for appointment of Adviser to  the  Administrator.
The officers appointed as Adviser  are  invariably  members  of  the  Indian
Administrative Service.

40.   After about 2 years of the issuance of the  first  notification  under
Article 239(1) of the  Constitution,  by  which  the  powers  and  functions
exercisable by the  State  Government  under  various  laws  were  generally
entrusted to the Administrator, Notification dated 8.10.1968 was issued  and
the earlier notification was modified insofar as it related to the  exercise
of powers  and  functions  by  the  Administrator  under  the  Act  and  the
President directed that subject to his control  and  until  further  orders,
the powers and functions of  ‘the  appropriate  Government’  shall  also  be
exercised  and  discharged  by  the   Administrator.    Notification   dated
8.10.1968 was superseded by Notification dated 1.1.1970  and  the  President
directed that subject to his control and until further  orders,  the  powers
and functions of ‘the appropriate Government’ shall also  be  exercised  and
discharged by the Administrator of every Union Territory  whether  known  as
the Administrator, the Chief Commissioner or the Lieutenant  Governor.   The
last notification in the series was  issued  on  14.8.1989  superseding  all
previous Notifications.  The language of that notification is  identical  to
the language of Notification dated 1.1.1970.

41.   There is marked distinction  in  the  language  of  the  notifications
issued under Article 239(1)  of  the  Constitution.  By  notification  dated
1.11.1966, the President generally delegated the  powers  and  functions  of
the  State  Government  under  various  laws  in  force  immediately  before
1.11.1966 to the  Administrator.  By  all  other  notifications,  the  power
exercisable by ‘the appropriate Government’  under  the  Act  and  the  Land
Acquisition (Companies) Rules, 1963 were  delegated  to  the  Administrator.
It is not too difficult to  fathom  the  reasons  for  this  departure  from
notification  dated  1.11.1966.  The  Council  of  Ministers  whose   advice
constitutes the foundation of the decision taken by the President  was  very
much conscious of the fact  that  compulsory  acquisition  of  land,  though
sanctioned  by  the  provision  of  the  Act  not  only  impacts  lives  and
livelihood of the farmers and other small landholders,  but  also  adversely
affect  the  agricultural  and  environment  and  ecology   of   the   area.
Therefore, with a view to avoid any possibility of misuse of  power  by  the
executive authorities, it has  been  repeatedly  ordained  that  powers  and
functions vested in ‘the appropriate Government’ under the Act and the  1963
Rules shall be  exercised  only  by  the  Administrator.   The  use  of  the
expression ‘shall also be exercised and discharged’ in  Notifications  dated
8.10.1968, 1.1.1970 and 14.8.1989 is a clear pointer in this direction.  The
seriousness with which the  Central  Government  has  viewed  such  type  of
acquisition is also reflected from the decision taken by the  Home  Minister
on 23.9.2010 in the context of the report of the  Special  Auditor  and  the
One-Man Committee. Thus, the acquisition of land for and on behalf of  Union
Territories must be sanctioned by the Administrator of the particular  Union
Territory and no other officer is competent to exercise the power vested  in
‘the appropriate Government’ under the Act and the Rules framed  thereunder.

42.   We may  now  advert  to  Notification  dated  25.2.1988  issued  under
Section 3(1) of the 1987 Act, vide which  the  Administrator  directed  that
any power, authority or jurisdiction or any duty which he could exercise  or
discharge by or under the provisions of any law,  rules  or  regulations  as
applicable to the Union  Territory  of  Chandigarh  shall  be  exercised  or
discharged by the Adviser except in cases or class of  cases  enumerated  in
the Schedule. There is nothing in the language of Section 3(1) of  the  1987
Act from which it can be inferred that the Administrator  can  delegate  the
power exercisable by ‘the appropriate Government’ under the  Act  which  was
specifically entrusted to him by the President under Article 239(1)  of  the
Constitution. Therefore, notification dated 25.2.1988 cannot be relied  upon
for contending that the  Administrator  had  delegated  the  power  of  ‘the
appropriate Government’ to the Adviser.

43.   The  issue  deserves  to  be  considered  from  another  angle.  While
delegating the power, authority or jurisdiction vested in him  by  or  under
any law, rules or regulations  as  applicable  to  the  Union  Territory  of
Chandigarh, the Administrator had used the expression ‘on the date  of  this
notification’.  This necessarily implies that the power of ‘the  appropriate
Government’  conferred  upon  or  entrusted  to  the  Administrator  by  the
President under Article 239(1) after 25.2.1988 were  not  delegated  to  the
Adviser. It is also apposite to note that Notification dated  14.8.1989  was
issued under Article 239(1) in supersession of  all  previous  notifications
relating to the exercise of  power  and  functions  under  the  Act  by  the
Administrators of various Union  Territories.   Therefore,  even  if  it  is
assumed  that  vide  Notification  dated  25.2.1988  the  Administrator  had
authorised  the  Adviser  to  exercise  the  power   of   ‘the   appropriate
Government’  under  the  Act,  after  the  issuance  of  Notification  dated
14.8.1989, the said delegation will be deemed to have ceased insofar as  the
exercise of power of ‘the appropriate Government’  under  the  Act  and  the
Rules framed thereunder is concerned and in the absence of fresh  delegation
by the Administrator, the Adviser could not have exercised the power of  the
appropriate Government and  sanctioned  the  acquisition  of  land  for  the
purposes specified in Notifications dated 26.6.2006 and 2.8.2006  nor  could
he symbolically accept  the  recommendations  of  the  LAO  and  record  his
satisfaction on  the  issue  of  need  of  land  for  the  specified  public
purposes.

44.   In view of the above discussion, we  hold  that  the  Adviser  to  the
Administrator was not competent to accord approval to the initiation of  the
acquisition proceedings or take decision on the  reports  submitted  by  the
LAO under Section 5-A (2) of the Act and record his  satisfaction  that  the
land was needed for the specified public purpose.

45.   The next question which requires determination is whether the  reports
prepared  by  the  LAO  under  Section  5A(2)  were  vitiated  due  to  non-
consideration of the objections filed by the landowners and the  same  could
not be made basis for deciding whether the land was really  needed  for  the
particular public purpose. A cursory reading of the reports of the  LAO  may
give an impression that he had applied mind to the  objections  filed  under
Section 5A(1) and assigned reasons for not  entertaining  the  same,  but  a
careful analysis thereof leaves no doubt that the officer concerned had  not
at all applied mind to the objections of the landowners and  merely  created
a  facade  of  doing  so.   In  the  opening  paragraph  under  the  heading
“Observations”, the LAO recorded that he had seen the  revenue  records  and
conducted spot inspection. He then reproduced the Statement of  Objects  and
Reasons contained in the Bill which led to the enactment of the  Punjab  New
Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952 and proceed to  extract  some  portion
of reply dated 31.7.2006 sent by the Administrator to Surinder Singh Brar.

46.   In the context of the statement contained in the  first  line  of  the
paragraph titled “Observations”, we  repeatedly  asked  Shri  Sudhir  Walia,
learned counsel assisting Dr. Rajiv Dhawan to show as to when  the  LAO  had
summoned the revenue records and when he had conducted spot  inspection  but
the learned counsel could not  produce  any  document  to  substantiate  the
statement contained in the two  reports  of  the  LAO.   This  leads  to  an
inference that, in both the reports, the  LAO  had  made  a  misleading  and
false statement about his having seen  the  revenue  records  and  conducted
spot inspection. That  apart,  the  reports  do  not  contain  any  iota  of
consideration of the objections filed by the landowners.  Mere  reproduction
of the  substance  of  the  objections  cannot  be  equated  with  objective
consideration thereof in the light of the submission made by  the  objectors
during the course of hearing. Thus, the violation of the mandate of  Section
5A(2) is writ large on the face of the reports prepared by the LAO.

47.   The reason why the LAO did not apply his mind to the objections  filed
by the appellants and other landowners is obvious. He was a  minion  in  the
hierarchy of the administration of the Union  Territory  of  Chandigarh  and
could not have even thought of making recommendations contrary to  what  was
contained in the letter sent by the Administrator to  Surinder  Singh  Brar.
If he had shown the courage of acting independently and made  recommendation
against the acquisition of land, he would  have  surely  been  shifted  from
that post and his career would have been  jeopardized.   In  the  system  of
governance which we  have  today,  junior  officers  in  the  administration
cannot even think of, what to say of, acting against the wishes/dictates  of
their superiors. One who violates this unwritten code of conduct does so  at
his own peril and is described  as  a  foolhardy.  Even  those  constituting
higher strata of services follow the path of least resistance  and  find  it
most convenient to tow the line of  their  superiors.   Therefore,  the  LAO
cannot be blamed  for  having  acted  as  an  obedient  subordinate  of  the
superior authorities, including the Administrator.  However, that cannot  be
a legitimate ground to approve the reports prepared by him  without  even  a
semblance of consideration of the objections filed  by  the  appellants  and
other landowners and we have no hesitation to hold that the  LAO  failed  to
discharge the statutory duty  cast  upon  him  to  prepare  a  report  after
objectively  considering  the  objections  filed  under  Section  5A(1)  and
submissions made by the objectors during the course of personal hearing.

48.   The Special Secretary, Finance and the Adviser  to  the  Administrator
also failed to act in consonance with the  mandate  of  Section  5A(2)  read
with  Section  6(1).  They  could  not  muster  courage  of  expressing   an
independent opinion on the issue of compliance of Section  5A  and  need  of
the land for the specified public purposes.   The  noting  recorded  by  the
Special Secretary, Finance, which has been extracted hereinabove shows  that
the officer had virtually reproduced what the  Administrator  had  mentioned
in his letter dated 31.7.2006.  The Adviser went a step further.  He  merely
appended his signatures on the  note  recorded  by  the  Special  Secretary,
Finance forgetting that in terms of the  aforementioned  two  sections  ‘the
appropriate Government’ is required to take decision after  considering  the
report of the LAO. The least which can be said about  the  manner  in  which
the Adviser approved the note prepared by the Special Secretary, Finance  is
that there was abject failure on  the  part  of  the  concerned  officer  to
discharge his duty despite the fact that he was entrusted with  the  onerous
task of taking a decision on behalf of ‘the  appropriate  Government’  after
considering the reports of the LAO. The casual manner in  which  the  senior
officers of the Chandigarh Administration dealt with the  serious  issue  of
the acquisition of land of citizens signifies their total  lack  of  respect
for the constitutional provision contained in Article 300A, the law  enacted
by Parliament, that is, the Act and interpretation thereof  by  the  Courts.
It seems that the officers were  overawed  by  the  view  expressed  by  the
Administrator and the instinct of self-preservation prompted them not to  go
against the wishes of the Administrator who wanted that additional  land  be
acquired in the name of expansion  of  IT  Park  despite  the  fact  that  a
substantial portion of the land acquired for Phase II had been  allotted  to
a private developer.

49.   At this stage, it will be useful to notice the provisions of  Sections
3(ee), 3(f) (as substituted by Act No.68 of 1984), 4(1), 5A and  6(1).   The
same read as under:

      “3(ee) the expression “appropriate Government” means, in  relation  to
      acquisition of land  for  the  purposes  of  the  Union,  the  Central
      Government, and, in relation to acquisition  of  land  for  any  other
      purposes, the State Government;

      3 (f) the expression ‘public purpose’ includes-

      (i) the  provision  of  village-  sites,  or  the  extension,  planned
      development or improvement of existing village- sites;

      (ii) the provision of land for town or rural planning;

      (iii) the provision of land  for  planned  development  of  land  from
      public funds in pursuance of any scheme or policy  of  Government  and
      subsequent disposal thereof in whole or in part by  lease,  assignment
      or outright sale with the object of securing  further  development  as
      planned;

      (iv) the provision of land for a corporation owned  or  controlled  by
      the State;

      (v) the provision of land for residential  purposes  to  the  poor  or
      landless  or  to  persons  residing  in  areas  affected  by   natural
      calamities, or to persons displaced  or  affected  by  reason  of  the
      implementation of any  scheme  undertaken  by  Government,  any  local
      authority or a corporation owned or controlled by the State;

      (vi) the provision of land for carrying out any educational,  housing,
      health or slum clearance scheme sponsored  by  Government  or  by  any
      authority established by Government for carrying out any such  scheme,
      or with the prior approval of the appropriate Government, by  a  local
      authority, or a society registered under  the  Societies  Registration
      Act, 1860 (21 of 1860 ), or under any corresponding law for  the  time
      being in force in a state, or  a  co-  operative  society  within  the
      meaning of any law relating to co- operative societies  for  the  time
      being in force in any State;

      (vii) the provision of  land  for  any  other  scheme  of  development
      sponsored by Government or with the prior approval of the  appropriate
      Government, by a local authority;

      (viii) the provision of any premises or building for locating a public
      office, but does not include acquisition of land for companies;

      4. Publication of preliminary notification and power of officers
      thereupon.-

      (1) Whenever it appears to the appropriate Government the land in  any
      locality is needed or is likely to be needed for any public purpose or
      for a company, a notification to that effect shall be published in the
      Official Gazette and in  two  daily  newspapers  circulating  in  that
      locality of which at least one shall be in the regional language,  and
      the Collector shall cause public  notice  of  the  substance  of  such
      notification to be given at convenient places in the said locality the
      last of the dates of such publication and the giving  of  such  public
      notice, being hereinafter referred to as the date of  the  publication
      of the notification.

            xxx              xxx              xxx


      5A. Hearing of objections.-


      (1) Any person interested in any land which has  been  notified  under
      section 4, sub- section (1), as being needed or likely  to  be  needed
      for a public purpose or for a Company may, within thirty days from the
      date of the publication of the notification, object to the acquisition
      of the land or of any land in the locality, as the case may be.

      (2) Every objection under sub-  section  (1)  shall  be  made  to  the
      Collector in writing, and the Collector shall  give  the  objector  an
      opportunity of being heard[ in person or by any person  authorized  by
      him in this behalf] or by pleader and shall, after  hearing  all  such
      objections and after making such further inquiry, if any, as he thinks
      necessary, either make a report in respect of the land which has  been
      notified under section 4, sub- section (1), or make different  reports
      in respect of different parcels  of  such  land,  to  the  appropriate
      Government, containing his recommendations on the objections, together
      with the record of the proceedings held by him, for  the  decision  of
      that Government. The decision of the  appropriate  Government  on  the
      objections shall be final.

      (3) For the purpose of this section, a person shall be  deemed  to  be
      interested in land who would be  entitled  to  claim  an  interest  in
      compensation if the land were acquired under this Act.

      6. Declaration that land is required for a public purpose.-

      (1) Subject to the provision  of  Part  VII  of  this  Act,  when  the
      appropriate Government is satisfied, after considering the report,  if
      any, made under section 5A, sub- section (2), that any particular land
      is needed for a public purpose, or for a Company, a declaration  shall
      be made to that effect under the signature  of  a  Secretary  to  such
      Government or of some officer duly authorized to  certify  its  orders
      and different declarations may be made from time to time in respect of
      different parcels of any land covered by the same  notification  under
      section 4, sub- section (I) irrespective  of  whether  one  report  or
      different reports has or have  been  made  (wherever  required)  under
      section 5A, sub-section (2):

      Provided that no declaration in respect of any particular land covered
      by a notification under section 4, sub-section (1),—


        (i) published  after  the  commencement  of  the  Land  Acquisition
        (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, 1967 (1 of 1967), but  before
        the commencement of the Land  Acquisition  (Amendment)  Act,  1984,
        shall be made after the expiry of three years from the date of  the
        publication of the notification; or


        (ii) published after  the  commencement  of  the  Land  Acquisition
        (Amendment) Act, 1984, shall be made after the expiry of  one  year
        from the date of the publication of the notification:

      Provided further that no such declaration shall  be  made  unless  the
      compensation to be awarded for such  property  is  to  be  paid  by  a
      Company, or wholly or partly put  of  public  revenues  or  some  fund
      controlled or managed by a local authority.

      Explanation I.—In computing any of the  periods  referred  to  in  the
      first proviso, the period during which any action or proceeding to  be
      taken in pursuance of the notification issued under  section  4,  sub-
      section (1), is stayed by an order of a Court shall be excluded.

      Explanation 2.—Where the compensation to be awarded for such  property
      is to be paid out of the funds of a corporation owned or controlled by
      the State, such compensation shall be deemed to be  compensation  paid
      out of public revenues.

      (2) Every declaration shall be published in the Official Gazette,  and
      in two daily newspapers circulating in the locality in which the  land
      is situate of which at least one shall be in  the  regional  language,
      and the Collector shall cause public notice of the substance  of  such
      declaration to be given at convenient places in the said locality (the
      last of the date of such publication and the  giving  of  such  public
      notice, being hereinafter referred to as the date of  the  publication
      of the declaration), and such declaration shall state the district  or
      other territorial division in which the land is situate,  the  purpose
      for which it is needed, its approximate area, and, where a plan  shall
      have been made  of  the  land,  the  place  where  such  plan  may  be
      inspected.

      (3) The said declaration shall be conclusive evidence that the land is
      needed for a public purpose or for a Company, as the case may be; and,
      after making such declaration, the appropriate Government may  acquire
      the land in manner hereinafter appearing.”


 50.   Section 4(1) lays down that whenever it appears  to  the  appropriate
Government that land in any locality is needed or is  likely  to  be  needed
for any public purpose or for a company, then a notification to that  effect
is  required  to  be  published  in  the  Official  Gazette  and  two  daily
newspapers having circulation in the locality. Of these, one  paper  has  to
be in the regional language. A duty  is  also  cast  on  the  Collector,  as
defined in Section 3(c), to cause public notice of  the  substance  of  such
notification to be given at convenient places  in  the  locality.  The  last
date of publication and giving of public notice is treated as  the  date  of
publication of the notification.

51.   Section 5A, which embodies the most important dimension of  the  rules
of natural justice, lays  down  that  any  person  interested  in  any  land
notified under Section 4(1) may,  within  30  days  of  publication  of  the
notification, submit objection in writing against the  proposed  acquisition
of land or of any land in the locality to the Collector.  The  Collector  is
required to give the objector  an  opportunity  of  being  heard  either  in
person or by any person authorised by him or by pleader. After  hearing  the
objector(s) and making such further inquiry, as he may think necessary,  the
Collector has to make a report in respect of  land  notified  under  Section
4(1) with his recommendations on the objections and forward the same to  the
Government along with the  record  of  the  proceedings  held  by  him.  The
Collector can make different reports in  respect  of  different  parcels  of
land proposed to be acquired.

52.   Upon receipt of the Collector's report, the appropriate Government  is
required to take action under  Section  6(1)  which  lays  down  that  after
considering the report, if any, made under Section 5-A(2),  the  appropriate
Government is satisfied that any particular land  is  needed  for  a  public
purpose, then a declaration to that effect is required to be made under  the
signatures of a  Secretary  to  the  Government  or  of  some  officer  duly
authorised to certify its orders. This  section  also  envisages  making  of
different declarations from time to time in respect of different parcels  of
land covered by the same notification issued under Section  5(1).  In  terms
of clause (ii) of the proviso to Section 6(1), no declaration in respect  of
any particular land covered by a notification  issued  under  Section  4(1),
which is published after 24-9-1989 can be made  after  expiry  of  one  year
from the date of publication of the notification. To put it  differently,  a
declaration is required to be made under Section 6(1) within one  year  from
the date of publication of the notification under Section 4(1).

53.   In terms of Section 6(2), every declaration made  under  Section  6(1)
is required to be published  in  the  Official  Gazette  and  in  two  daily
newspapers having circulation in the locality in which the land proposed  to
be acquired is situated. Of these, at least one  must  be  in  the  regional
language. The Collector is also required  to  cause  public  notice  of  the
substance of such declaration to  be  given  at  convenient  places  in  the
locality. The declaration to be published under Section  6(2)  must  contain
the district or other territorial division in which  the  land  is  situate,
the purpose for which it is needed, its approximate area or a plan  is  made
in respect of land and the place where such plan can be inspected.

54.   Section 6(3) lays down that the declaration made  under  Section  6(1)
shall be conclusive evidence of the fact that land is needed  for  a  public
purpose.  After  publication  of  the  declaration  under  Section  6,   the
Collector is required to take  order  from  the  State  Government  for  the
acquisition of land to be carved out and measured and  planned  (Sections  7
and 8).  The  next  stage  as  envisaged  is  issue  of  public  notice  and
individual notice to the persons interested in the land to file their  claim
for compensation. Section 11 envisages holding of an enquiry into the  claim
and passing of an award by the  Collector  who  is  required  to  take  into
consideration the provisions contained in Section 23.

55.   In Nandeshwar Prasad and Anr.  v.  The  State  of  Uttar  Pradesh  and
Ors.  (1964) 3  SCR  425,  this  Court  observed  that  the  right  to  file
objections under  Section  5-A  is  a  substantial  right  when  a  person’s
property is being threatened with acquisition.  In Munshi Singh v. Union  of
India (1973) 2 SCC 337, the importance of the rule of  hearing  embodied  in
Section 5-A was highlighted in the following words:

      “Section 5-A embodies a very  just  and  wholesome  principle  that  a
      person whose property is being or is intended to  be  acquired  should
      have a proper and reasonable opportunity of persuading the authorities
      concerned that acquisition of the property belonging  to  that  person
      should not be made. We may refer to the observation of this  court  in
      Nandeshwar Prasad v. State of U.P that the right  to  file  objections
      under Section 5-A is a substantial right when a person's  property  is
      being threatened with acquisition and that right cannot be taken  away
      as if by a  side  wind.  Sub-section  (2)  of  Section  5-A  makes  it
      obligatory on the Collector to give  an  objector  an  opportunity  of
      being heard. After hearing all objections and making  further  inquiry
      he is to make a report to the appropriate  Government  containing  his
      recommendation on the objections.  The  decision  of  the  appropriate
      Government on the objections is  then  final.  The  declaration  under
      Section  6  has  to  be  made  after  the  appropriate  Government  is
      satisfied, on a consideration of the  report,  if  any,  made  by  the
      Collector under Section 5-A(2). The legislature has,  therefore,  made
      complete provisions for the  persons  interested  to  file  objections
      against the  proposed  acquisition  and  for  the  disposal  of  their
      objections.”
                                                         (emphasis supplied)



56.   In State of Punjab v. Gurdial  Singh  (1980)  2  SCC  471,  the  Court
observed:

      “……it is fundamental that compulsory taking of a man's property  is  a
      serious matter and the smaller the man the more  serious  the  matter.
      Hearing him before depriving him is both reasonable and pre-emptive of
      arbitrariness,  and  denial  of  this   administrative   fairness   is
      constitutional anathema except for good reasons.”



57.   In Hindustan Petroleum  Corporation  Ltd.  v.  Darius  Shapur  Chenai
(2005) 7 SCC 627, this Court analysed Section 5-A in the following words:

      “………..Section 5-A of  the  Act  is  in  two  parts.  Upon  receipt  of
      objections, the Collector is required to make such further enquiry  as
      he may think necessary whereupon  he  must  submit  a  report  to  the
      appropriate Government in respect of the land which  is  the  subject-
      matter of notification under Section 4(1) of the Act. The said  report
      would also contain recommendations on  the  objections  filed  by  the
      owner of the land. He is  required  to  forward  the  records  of  the
      proceedings held by him together with the report. On receipt of such a
      report together with the records of the case,  the  Government  is  to
      render a decision thereupon. It is now  well  settled  in  view  of  a
      catena of decisions that the declaration made under Section 6  of  the
      Act need not contain any reason. ………. However, considerations  of  the
      objections by the  owner  of  the  land  and  the  acceptance  of  the
      recommendations by the Government, it is trite, must precede a  proper
      application of mind on the part of the Government.  ……….  Furthermore,
      the State is required to apply its mind not  only  on  the  objections
      filed by the owner of the  land  but  also  on  the  report  which  is
      submitted by the Collector upon making  other  and  further  enquiries
      therefor as also the recommendations made by him in that  behalf.  The
      State Government may further inquire into the matter, if any  case  is
      made out therefor, for arriving at its own  satisfaction  that  it  is
      necessary to deprive a citizen of his right to property.”



58.   What needs to be emphasised is that  hearing  required  to  be  given
under Section 5A(2) to a person who is sought to be deprived  of  his  land
and who has filed objections under Section 5A(1) must be effective and  not
an empty formality. The Collector who is enjoined with the task of  hearing
the objectors has the freedom of making further enquiry  as  he  may  think
necessary. In either eventuality, he has to make report in respect  of  the
land notified under Section 4(1) or make different reports  in  respect  of
different parcels of such land to the appropriate Government containing his
recommendations on the objections and submit the same  to  the  appropriate
Government along with the  record  of  proceedings  held  by  him  for  the
latter’s decision. The appropriate Government is obliged  to  consider  the
report, if any, made under Section 5A(2) and then record  its  satisfaction
that the particular land is needed for  a  public  purpose.  This  exercise
culminates into making a declaration that the land is needed for  a  public
purpose and the  declaration  is  to  be  signed  by  a  Secretary  to  the
Government or some other officer duly authorised to certify its orders. The
formation of opinion on the issue of need of land for a public purpose  and
suitability thereof is sine qua  non  for  issue  of  a  declaration  under
Section 6(1). Any violation of the  substantive  right  of  the  landowners
and/or other interested persons to file objections or denial of opportunity
of personal hearing to the objector(s) vitiates the recommendations made by
the Collector and the decision taken by the appropriate Government on  such
recommendations. The recommendations made by  the  Collector  without  duly
considering the objections filed under Section 5A(1) and  submissions  made
at the hearing given under Section 5A(2)  or  failure  of  the  appropriate
Government to take objective decision on such objections in  the  light  of
the recommendations made by the Collector will denude the decision  of  the
appropriate Government of statutory finality. To put  it  differently,  the
satisfaction recorded by the appropriate  Government  that  the  particular
land is needed for a public purpose and the declaration made under  Section
6(1) will be devoid of legal sanctity if statutorily  engrafted  procedural
safeguards are not adhered to by the  concerned  authorities  or  there  is
violation of the principles of natural justice.  The cases  before  us  are
illustrative of flagrant violation of the mandate  of  Sections  5A(2)  and
6(1).  Therefore,  the second question is answered in affirmative.

59.   Before parting with this aspect of the case, we consider it proper to
deal with the two judgments relied upon by Dr. Dhawan  in  support  of  his
submission that the declaration issued under Section 6(1) is conclusive and
the satisfaction recorded by the competent authority cannot be subjected to
judicial review.  In Somawanti v. State of Punjab (supra), after  analysing
the relevant provisions, the majority of the Constitution Bench observed:

      “The scheme of the Act is that normally the provisions of Section  5-A
      have to be complied with.  Where,  in  pursuance  of  the  provisions,
      objections are lodged, these objections will have to be decided by the
      Government. For deciding them the Government will have before  it  the
      Collector's proceedings.  It  would,  therefore,  be  clear  that  the
      declaration that a particular land is needed for a public purpose  for
      a company is not to be made by the Government arbitrarily, but on  the
      basis of material placed before it by the Collector. The provision  of
      sub-section (2) of Section 5-A make the decision of the Government  on
      the objections final while those  of  sub-section  (1)  of  Section  6
      enable the Government to arrive at its satisfaction.  Sub-section  (3)
      of Section 6 goes further and says that such a  declaration  shall  be
      conclusive evidence that the land is needed for a  public  purpose  or
      for a company.

      The Government has to be satisfied about both the  elements  contained
      in the expression “needed for a public purpose or a company”. Where it
      is so satisfied, it is entitled to make a  declaration.  Once  such  a
      declaration is made sub-section (3) invests  it  with  conclusiveness.
      That  conclusiveness  is  not  merely  regarding  the  fact  that  the
      Government is satisfied but also with regard to the question that  the
      land is needed for a public purpose or is needed for a company, as the
      case may be. Then again, the conclusiveness  must  necessarily  attach
      not merely to the need but also to the question whether the purpose is
      a public purpose or what is said to be a company is a  company.  There
      can be no “need” in the abstract. It must be  a  need  for  a  “public
      purpose” or for a company.

 The Act has empowered the Government to determine the question of  the
      need  of  land  for  a  public  purpose  or  for  a  company  and  the
      jurisdiction conferred upon it to do so is not made  conditional  upon
      the existence of a collateral or extraneous fact. It is the  existence
      of the need for a public  purpose  which  gives  jurisdiction  to  the
      Government to make a declaration under Section 6(1) and makes  it  the
      sole judge whether there is in fact a need and whether the purpose for
      which there is that need is a public purpose. The provisions  of  sub-
      section (3) preclude a court from ascertaining whether either of these
      ingredients of the declaration exists.”
                                                         (emphasis supplied)



60.   In Ganga Bishnu Swaika v. Calcutta Pinjrapole  Society  (supra),  the
two-Judge Bench considered the amendment  made  in  the  Act  in  1923  and
observed:

      “As sub-section (1) stood prior to 1923 the words were “subject to the
      provisions of Part VII of the  Act,  when  it  appears  to  the  Local
      Government that any particular land is needed for a public purpose  or
      for a Company, a declaration shall be made etc. The amendment of  1923
      dropped  these  words  and  substituted  the  words  “when  the  Local
      Government is satisfied after considering the  report,  if  any,  made
      under Section 5-A, sub-section (2)” etc. It seems that  the  amendment
      was considered necessary  because  the  same  Amendment  Act  inserted
      Section 5-A for the first time in  the  Act  which  gave  a  right  to
      persons interested in the land to be acquired to file  objections  and
      of being heard thereon by the Collector. The new section enjoined upon
      the Collector to consider such objections and make  a  report  to  the
      Government, whose decision on such  objections  was  made  final.  One
      reason why the  word  “satisfaction”  was  substituted  for  the  word
      “appears” seems to be that since  it  was  the  Government  who  after
      considering the objections and the report of the Collector thereon was
      to arrive at its decision and then make the  declaration  required  by
      sub-section (2), the  appropriate  words  would  be  “when  the  Local
      Government is satisfied” rather than the words “when it appears to the
      Local Government”. The other reason which presumably led to the change
      in the language was to bring the words in sub-section (1) of Section 6
      in line with the words used in Section 40 where the Government  before
      granting its consent to the acquisition  for  a  Company  has  to  “be
      satisfied” on an inquiry held  as  provided  thereinafter.  Since  the
      Amendment Act 38 of 1923 provided an inquiry into  the  objections  of
      persons interested in the land under Section 5-A, Section 40 also  was
      amended by adding therein the words  “either  on  the  report  of  the
      Collector under  Section  5-A  or”.  Section  41  which  requires  the
      acquiring Company to enter into an agreement with the Government  also
      required satisfaction of the Government after considering  the  report
      on the inquiry held under Section 40. The Amendment Act 38 of 1923 now
      added in Section 41 the report of the Collector under Section 5-A,  if
      any. These amendments show that even prior to the 1923 Amendment  Act,
      whenever the Government was required by the Act to consider a  report,
      the legislature had used the word satisfaction  on  the  part  of  the
      Government. Since  the  Amendment  Act  1923  introduced  Section  5-A
      requiring the Collector to hold an inquiry and to make  a  report  and
      required the Government to consider that  report  and  the  objections
      dealt with in it, the legislature presumably thought it appropriate to
      use the same expression which it had used in Sections 40 and 41  where
      also an inquiry was provided for and the Government  had  to  consider
      the report of the  officer  making  such  inquiry  before  giving  its
      consent.

      Sub-section (1) provides that when the Government is satisfied that  a
      particular land is needed for a public purpose or  for  a  Company,  a
      declaration shall be  made  “to  that  effect”.  Satisfaction  of  the
      Government after consideration of  the  report,  if  any,  made  under
      Section  5-A  is  undoubtedly  a  condition  precedent  to   a   valid
      declaration, for, there can be no  valid  acquisition  under  the  Act
      unless the Government is satisfied that the land  to  be  acquired  is
      needed for a public purpose or for a Company. But there is nothing  in
      sub-section (1) which requires that such satisfaction need  be  stated
      in the declaration. The only declaration as required by sub-section  1
      is that the land to be acquired is needed for a public purpose or  for
      a Company. Sub-section (2) makes this clear, for it  clearly  provides
      that the declaration “shall state” where such land  is  situate,  “the
      purpose for which it is needed”, its approximate area and  the  place.
      Where its plan, if made, can be inspected. It is  such  a  declaration
      made under sub-section (1) and published under sub-section  (2)  which
      becomes conclusive evidence that the particular land is needed  for  a
      public purpose or for a Company as the case  may  be.  The  contention
      therefore  that  it  is  imperative  that  the  satisfaction  must  be
      expressed in the declaration or that otherwise the notification  would
      not be in accord with Section 6 is not correct.”
                                                         (emphasis supplied)



61.   The proposition laid down in the aforementioned  two  judgments  does
not support the stance of the Chandigarh Administration  that  even  though
there is breach of the mandate of Section 5A read with  Section  6(1),  the
Court cannot, after the issue of declaration under  Section  6(1),  nullify
the acquisition proceedings.  As a matter of fact, the ratio  of  both  the
judgments is that satisfaction of the appropriate Government  envisaged  in
Section 6(1) must be preceded by consideration of the  report  prepared  by
the Collector after considering the objections filed under Section  5A  and
hearing the objectors.  This necessarily implies that the  Government  must
objectively apply  its  mind  to  the  report  of  the  Collector  and  the
objections filed by the landowners and then take a decision whether or  not
the land  is  needed  for  the  specified  public  purpose.   A  mechanical
endorsement of the report of the Collector cannot be a substitute  for  the
requirement of application of mind by the Government which must be  clearly
reflected in the record.

62.   In addition to what  we  have  observed  on  the  issue  of  flagrant
violation of the two sections, it will  be  apposite  to  recapitulate  the
language  of  the  declarations  issued  under  Section  6(1),  which  were
published on 28.2.2007.  A reading of the declarations makes it clear  that
the authority issuing the same was totally unmindful of the requirement  of
the statute.  This could be  the  only  reason  why  instead  of  recording
satisfaction of the appropriate Government that the land is  needed  for  a
public purpose, the notification  uses  the  expressions  “appears  to  the
Administrator” and “likely to be needed”.  This only adds to the casualness
with which the entire issue of acquisition  has  been  dealt  with  by  the
higher functionaries of the Chandigarh Administration.

63.   Adverting to the impugned order, we find that the High Court has  not
examined the substantive grounds on which the appellants had challenged the
acquisition of their land with  the  required  seriousness  and  failed  to
notice that the LAO had not at all considered several objections  including
those relating to adverse impact on the environment and ecology of the area
raised by the landowners and mechanically recommended  the  acquisition  of
land notified under Section 4(1), that the reports  of  the  LAO  were  not
placed before the competent authority and that even  the  Advisor  had  not
objectively considered  the  reports  of  the  LAO  in  the  light  of  the
objections filed under Section 5A(1) and simply appended his signatures  on
the note prepared by the Secretary (Finance).  This omission  on  the  High
Court’s part has resulted in miscarriage of justice.

64.   In view of the findings recorded on the main  questions,  we  do  not
consider it necessary to deal with and decide other questions including the
one that the purpose specified in the notifications issued  under  Sections
4(1) and 6(1) was not a bona fide public purpose and that in  the  garb  of
acquiring land for IT Park etc., the Chandigarh  Administration  wanted  to
favour the private developers.

65.   In the result, the appeals are allowed, the  impugned  order  is  set
aside and Notifications dated 26.6.2006, 2.8.2006 and 28.2.2007  issued  by
the Chandigarh Administration under Sections 4(1) and 6(1) of the  Act  are
quashed. The parties are left to bear their own costs.
