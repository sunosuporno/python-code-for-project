      conspired and actually conducted one blast on 21.05.1996,

      at a crowded central market, Lajpat Nagar, New Delhi.

3.    In   connection   with   another   FIR   No.286/1996     dated

      Court for theft in connection with a main crime, against the

      very same four, out of seventeen, accused persons.

6.   It is a matter of record that neither the Accused nor the State

     preferred any appeal against the judgment of acquittal

     and/or conviction and corresponding sentence in relation to

     A1 to A2.     Equally, no appeal was preferred against the

     judgment of acquittal of A4, A7, A8 and A10 on all counts.

     As also judgment of acquittal of some of the accused in

     relation to some of the charged offences.

7.   Only the accused A3, A5, A6 and A9 preferred separate

     appeals assailing the judgment of their conviction and

     sentence rendered by the Trial Court.       The death sentence

     awarded against three of the accused was referred for

     confirmation to the jurisdictional High Court which was

     registered as Death Sentence Reference No.2 of 2010 and the

     appeals preferred by the accused were registered as Criminal

     Appeal Nos.948, 949, 950 and 951 of 2010 which stand

     decided vide common judgment dated 22.11.2012 rendered

     by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi, in terms whereof,

     the accused were either acquitted and/or their conviction

     affirmed only in relation to certain offences.

     Prosecution Case

10. The prosecution case emerging from the record, also as set

       out by the Courts below, is as under:
                                8



10.1 On 21.05.1996, a bomb blast took place in the Central

    Market, Lajpat Nagar, New Delhi, at 6.30 PM. This incident

    resulted in 13 deaths and 38 injuries, besides extensive loss

    to properties, both moveable and immoveable. PW-21 was

    the first one to inform the police about the incident; he

    witnessed the incident and reported to the concerned Police

    Station on the basis of which the FIR was lodged. The same

    evening there were media reports that Jammu Kashmir

    Islamic Front (JKIF, in short) had claimed responsibility for

    the horrific event. Investigation started and the police traced

    the calls received by TV Channels - Zee News etc. and found

    them to have emanated from two different telephone

    numbers in the Kashmir Valley. The Jammu Kashmir Police

    was intimated about these facts; and the police were

    provided with the two telephone numbers; the first was

    registered in the name of A1’s (Farooq Ahmed Khan’s) father

    and the second was installed in the house of A2 (Farida

    Dar). Those two accused were arrested on 24.05.1996 by

    the J&K Police. Subsequently, PW-49 Jasbir Malik formally

    arrested them on 25.05.1996 on behalf of the Delhi Police
                                 9


    and after bringing them from Srinagar, produced them

    before the Metropolitan Magistrate, Patiala House, Delhi on

    26.05.1996 and obtained their remand.

10.2 The prosecution claimed that the Police obtained a break-

    through with the arrest of A9 - Javed on 01.06.1996 at

    Ahmedabad by the Gujrat Police, and his making a

    disclosure statement Ex.PW-99/B revealing the details of

    the various stages in which the explosives were brought into

    India and    also revealing the names of the master mind

    behind the bomb blast, which included Bilal Ahmed Beg

    (A11), Juber @ Mehrazuddin (A12), Mohd. Ashraf Bhatt

    (A14), Javed Kariwar @ Javed Ahmed Goojri (A15), Ibrahim

    Abdul Razak Menan @ Muslaq @ Tiger Menon (A16) and

    Daud Hassan Sheikh (A17). On the basis of the information

    disclosed by A9 Javed, the police claimed to have verified

    certain facts from PW-13 Wazid Kasai and his sister Pappi

    (PW-14). In the statements recorded under Section 161

    Cr.P.C, these two witnesses partially lent corroboration to

    disclosure statement of A9 vis-a-vis handing over of

    explosive   materials   to   other   conspirators   which   were

    ultimately used in the bombing incident of 21.05.1996.
                                 10
     During the course of investigation, A-3’s name cropped up

     as one of the key figures instrumental in the bomb blast.

     Several unsuccessful attempts were made to nab him and

     ultimately on 14.06.1996, upon the receipt of a tipoff, the

     police arrested him (A3) along with Mirza Iftekar (A4) from

     the New Delhi Railway Station at 7:40 PM while trying to

     board a train Vaishali Express to Gorakhpur. On the basis

     of   disclosure   statements      made   by   A3,    several    vital

     incriminating materials in the form of explosives (2 slabs of

     RDX, 1 timer, 1 iron solder, 1 wire cutter, 2 araldite tubes, 1

     gas cylinder and 1 detonator) were seized. Similarly,

     recoveries of incriminating material were allegedly made at

     the behest of A4. Both these recoveries were effected on

     15.06.1996.

10.3 Also,   the   police   obtained    information      regarding    the

     whereabouts of other two accused, i.e., A5 - Mirza Nissar

     Hussain @Naza and A6 - Mohd. Ali Bhatt @Killey. The police

     party apparently went along with A3 & A4 to Gorakhpur

     and on 16.06.1996 arrested Killey (A6) and Latif Ahmed

     (A7). The police, on the basis of disclosure statement made

     by Latif Ahmed (A7) recovered a torn half of a two rupee
                             11


    note, which was a key to obtain funds for Naushad (A3),

    through a hawala transaction from one Mangal Chand in

    Delhi. On the basis of further information received on

    17.06.1996, the police party arrested A5 Naza from

    Mussoorie.

10.4 On the basis of disclosure statements recorded by A6 and

    A7, a police party went to Shalimar Bagh, Delhi on

    17.06.1996; the place was identified by the accused A7,

    from where thereafter a torn half two rupee note was given

    to Mangal Chand, who in turn handed over Rupees one lakh

    in cash to A4 to be given to A3 (Naushad). The Seizure

    Memo in respect of the said money was prepared. The

    prosecution   sent   another   party   to   Gorakhpur   on

    18.06.1996 to seize relevant extracts of the guest house

    records as well as the railway reservation chart dated

    27.05.1996 (pertaining to Shaheed Express) to prove that

    Naushad had travelled from Gorakhpur to Delhi on that day.



10.5 In the meanwhile, Javed (A9) and Asadullah (A10) along

    with two others were detained in Ahmedabad. Both A9 and

    A10 were transferred to Jaipur where they were required in
                                12


     connection with another pending case involving trial for the

     offence punishable under Section 307 IPC. The prosecution

     case is that there was another bomb blast at Dausa,

     Rajasthan, in connection with which on 19.07.1996 the

     concerned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jaipur,

     namely,   Bhagwan    Das   (PW-100)    recorded   a   judicial

     confession of A9 - Javed (Ex.PW-100/A) wherein he narrated

     the sequence of events which he was aware of, implicating

     various accused as well as identifying their roles in

     connection with the bomb blast at Delhi. Apparently, A9 and

     A10 were kept in custody and eventually formally arrested

     by the Delhi Police on 26.07.1996.



10.6 Elaborating further, the case was registered on the basis of

     statement of Subhash Chand Katar, a shopkeeper of Pushpa

     Market as FIR No.517/96 (Ex. PW-5/A). He stated that at

     6:30 PM, a loud blast took place in a Maruti Car standing at

     around 10ft from his shop. Complainant was not aware of

     the registration number of the car. He did not know as to

     who had parked the said car in front of his shop. During

     further investigation, it transpired that this car was stolen
                               13


    on the intervening night of 17-18.05.96 from Nizamuddin

    East, for which the owner, PW8 - Atul Nath, had registered a

    complaint vide FIR No.286/96. The accused, by procuring

    different materials from different places, prepared and made

    an unsuccessful attempt of bomb blast on 19.05.1996 and

    eventually succeeded on 21.05.1996.



10.7 The investigation was taken over by the Crime Branch,

    Delhi. It is the prosecution’s case that A1 confessed that he

    had taken responsibility of Lajpat Nagar bomb blast by

    making phone calls to the media and A2 also confessed her

    involvement. In pursuance of disclosure statements of A1

    and A2, ammunition and explosives were recovered from

    their residence.



10.8 As stated earlier, on 01.06.1996, A9 - Javed Ahmed Khan

    and A10 - Abdul Gani Asadullah were arrested by the

    Gujarat Police in a different case. On 02.06.1996, Gujarat

    Police informed Delhi Police about arrest of A9 and A10 at

    Ahmedabad and their involvement in the Lajpat Nagar bomb

    blast. A9 in his disclosure statement to the Police revealed
                                14


     conspiracy   which   was   masterminded    by   A11   –     A17

     (Declared as ‘Proclaimed Offenders’) to cause and carry out

     acts of terrorism and disruptive activities in India. During

     this interrogation, Delhi Police was informed about the

     involvement of PW13, who then informed the police about

     the involvement of A3.

10.9 On 15.06.1996, A3 in his disclosure statement revealed how

     and under what circumstances, the bomb blast was caused.

     In pursuance of this statement, incriminating materials in

     the form of explosives were recovered from his residence.



10.10     On 18.06.1996 and 19.06.1996, A3, A5 and A6

   accompanied the police party and in furtherance of their

   disclosure statements, the discovery of following facts took

   place, which the prosecution has termed as “Pointing Out”:

          clock for using its part to make the bomb was purchased.


10.11 The prosecution, on completion of investigation, after

    obtaining opinion of various experts including explosives

    experts and collecting all other materials, filed the charge sheet

    for trial.   All appearing accused claimed not guilty. The
                               16


  prosecution relied on the testimonies of 107 witnesses and

  also several material exhibits which included seizure memo,

  pointing out memos (Discovery of fact), disclosure statements,

  confessional statements of A9 (Ex. 100/A). After the statement

  on behalf of accused under Section 313 of Code of Criminal

  Procedure (‘Cr.P.C.’) was recorded, A3 - Naushad chose to lead

  evidence in defence and relied upon the testimonies of the two

  witnesses : DW-1 - Shri Mukesh, a Section Officer, National

  Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and DW2 - Shri Arun

  Kumar Sharma, Public Relation Inspector.

  High Court and Trial Court Findings


11. As already observed, the Trial Court proceeded to convict A3,

    A5, A6 and A9 and acquitted A4, A7, A8 and A10. However,

    the High Court as the Appellate Court acquitted A5 and A6

    on all charges and convicted A3 of certain offences.    Both

    judgments running into almost 1000 pages deal with the

    prosecution case.   The findings of the Trial Court and the

    High Court on each of the circumstances brought out by the

    prosecution as culled out by the Trial Court, are summarised

    as follows:

12. On the basis of the above circumstances, the conclusion qua

   each of the accused with which we are concerned, can be

   summarised as under :

  Trial Court
   Accused No.3, Mohd. Naushad: [Para 643]
     On analysis of circumstance numbers 9, 10, 23, 26, 30, 31,

     32 and 46 and in the absence of any evidence to the

     contrary, the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable

     doubt that A3, along with his associates, not only hatched a

     criminal conspiracy to cause bomb blast at Lajpat Nagar

     but also actively participated in procurement of materials to

     execute the plan.    In his statement under Section 313

     Cr.P.C, he failed to justify the incriminating circumstances

     appearing against him. He failed to show, much less prove,

     that he was lifted from his house on the intervening night

     of 28/29.05.96 and falsely implicated in this case on

     14.06.96.   Thus, prosecution established commission of

     offence under Section 302, 307, 436, 411 and 120B of the

    IPC and Section 5 of Explosives Act.
   Accused No. 5, Mirza Nissar Hussain @ Naza: [Para 652]
    Confessional statement of A9, lead to the discovery of fact of

     this accused travelling to Delhi from Kathmandu; and his
                             33


  further disclosure statement lead to a discovery of fact

  pointing out the shop for purchase of wall clock; pointing

  out of ‘Dulhan Dupatta’ shop, where the vehicle was parked

  on the day of unsuccessful attempt; pointing out the shop

  from where battery was purchased; identification of shop

  from where solder was purchased; and identification of

  shop from where wire got soldered, proved the active role

  played by A5 in the incident. Significantly, he did not

  adduce    any   evidence    to   falsify   the   incriminating

  circumstances against him and failed to explain as to how

  A9, his associate, revealed his role in the incident. Thus,

  prosecution fully established commission of offence under

  Section 302, 307, 436, 411 and 120B of the IPC.
 Accused No. 6, Mohd. Ali Bhatt @ Killey: [Para 583]
  The role of A6 is akin to most of the circumstances to that

  of A5. Circumstances proved on record by the prosecution

  establish his involvement in the criminal conspiracy and

  his active participation in the commission of the incident.

  He travelled from Nepal to Delhi for the execution of the

  plan. His name finds mention in the confessional statement

  of A9. He also procured articles for preparation of the

  explosives along with A3 and A5.           He made elaborate
                                   34


     arrangements to procure the articles and took various steps

     for execution of the plan. He could not explain the

     incriminating circumstances appearing against him in his

     statement recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C.                 Thus,

     prosecution fully established commission of offence under

    Section 302, 307, 436, 411 and 120B of the IPC.
   Accused No. 9, Javed Ahmed Khan: [Para 660]
    A9 failed to prove that confessional statement Ex.PW100/A

     was not made by him or that it was retracted at any stage.

     He also failed to explain his presence in Delhi where he

     stayed at Satyam Hotel. He was a party to the conspiracy.

     Thus,   prosecution   fully        established   against   him   the

     commission of offence under Section 302, 307, 436 and

     120B of the IPC.

    High Court

13. Vide judgment and order dated 22.11.2012, the High Court

   upheld convictions of A3 & A9. However, conviction of A3

   under Section 411 Indian Penal Code (‘IPC) was set aside.

   The conviction of A5 and A6 was set aside on all counts.
   Accused No. 3: Out of the ten circumstances alleged

     against A3, his arrest from New Delhi Railway Station and

     recovery of explosives from his residence stands proved.
                             35


  [Para 253] These circumstances, in the opinion of the

  Court, are sufficient to uphold the conviction under Section

  5 of the Explosive Substances Act.
        Though, there is no direct evidence forthcoming about

  A3’s role in the blast, yet the circumstances proven are

  sufficient to establish that he was a conspirator, who

  intended to aid the charged offence(s). The recovery of lethal

  explosives from his residence, similar to the kind which

  resulted in the explosion at Lajpat Nagar, was not explained

  by him. [Para 266]
 Accused No. 5: The only circumstance held to have been

  proved was his travel from Kathmandu to Delhi, is in no

  manner advancing the case of the prosecution. None of the

  other circumstances stand proven.
 Accused No.6: None of the circumstances alleged against

  A6 have been held to be proved against him. [Para 253]
 Accused No. 9: Confessional Statement of A9, his stay at

  Satyam Hotel and his arrest, are found to be proved, hence

  his conviction is sustainable.




 Issue of Sentence: [Para 272]
                               36


     Accused No. 3: The case would not fall in the category of

     rarest of rare cases and the award of extreme penalty of

     sentence to death cannot be confirmed. A3 is thus

     sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life for the offence

     punishable under Section 120B read with Section 302 IPC.

     Sentences under other offences (except under Section 411

     for which he has been acquitted) are upheld.

     Accused No.9: The conviction and sentences as against A9

     are sustained.


  Submissions of Counsels


  Submissions on behalf of A3 - Mohd. Naushad

14. Mr. Siddharth Dave, Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of

    A3, placed the following submissions before this Court:

14.1 Starting point of the Prosecution case:
     The prosecution’s version of Police obtaining a breakthrough

     with the arrest of A9, on 01.06.1996, at Ahmedabad, in

     another case being FIR No.12/1996 is incorrect. From the

     deposition of PW101, Inspector Paras Nath, it is evident that

     the starting point of the investigation was the arrest of A1

     and A2 on 24.05.1996 by the Jammu and Kashmir Police as
                              37


    A1 in his disclosure statement had taken responsibility of

     the Lajpat Nagar bomb blast.
14.2 A conviction based on circumstantial evidence, required
     each and every link of the chain to be clearly
     established by reliable and clinching evidence:

    The link between A9 and the alleged crime is the alleged

    statement of PW13, of being handed over RDX.           Even

    though PW13 ought to have been arrayed as an accused,

    being an accomplice, yet he and his sister PW14 did not

    support the prosecution during trial.
    Therefore, the prosecution has failed to establish the basic

    and primary facts as to show how A3 was one of the

     conspirators of the crime.
14.3 Confession of A9 cannot be used against himself :
     The confession of A9, Ex.PW100/A recorded before

    Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jaipur (PW100), in

    another criminal case registered and tried in Jaipur has no

    connection with the blast at Lajpat Nagar, New Delhi, and

    cannot be relied upon as an incriminating circumstance in

    view of the Constitution Bench judgment in Hari Charan

    Kurmi & Jogia Hjam v. State of Bihar 1964 (6) SCR 623.

    Furthermore, A9 neither names A3 nor attributes any role

    towards him in the commission of the offence. Hence, the

    confession of a co-accused can only be used in support of
                               38


     other evidence and cannot be made the foundation of a

     conviction.
14.4 All the links of the chain were not established by the
     Prosecution thus further snapping the chain of
     circumstantial evidence:

     It is submitted that against A3, 20 circumstances were laid

     by the prosecution before the Trial Court, out of which only

     10 were proved. Further, in appeal the High Court held only

     2 circumstances to be proved: (1) Arrest of A3 on

     14.06.1996 from New Delhi Railway Station; and (2)

     Recovery of Explosives from his residence. Thus, not only

     has the chain of circumstances snapped but there is no

     basis for maintaining conviction, as arrest cannot be used

     as an incriminating circumstance and mere recovery

     without any evidence linking the same to the crime, cannot

     be a circumstance to convict an accused.

          Reliance is placed on Ram Singh v. Sonia & Ors,

     (2007) 3 SCC 1; Dharam Das Wadhwani v. State of Uttar

     Pradesh, (1974) 3 SCR 607 and Sharad Birdhichand

     Sarda v. State of Maharashtra, (1984) 4 SCC 116.

14.5 Prosecution has failed to prove the arrest of A3:
     It is submitted that the first circumstance in the chain qua

     A3 is his arrest along with Accused No.4 on 14.06.1996
                           39


from Platform No.4, New Delhi Railway Station. This

circumstance is not proved, as the secret informer who

passed an information of this travel to PW101 - Paras Nath,

was not examined by the prosecution and PW16 has not

supported the prosecution on this issue.

     It is further submitted that, in fact, A3 was arrested on

the intervening night of 28 th/29th May at 3:30AM from his

residence. His neighbours PW12 - Ikram and PW92 – Abdul

Samad prove such fact. Also DW1- Mukesh, Section Officer,

NHRC, and DW2 - Arun Kumar have established that on

03.06.1996 father of A3 had lodged a complaint with

various authorities including the NHRC pertaining to the

illegal detention of his son, which fact stands ignored by the

courts below.       There is no independent witness to

corroborate the alleged arrest of A3, despite the place being

a crowded railway platform where independent witnesses

were readily available.
     A4 - Mirza Iftqar Hussain alias Saba, who was

allegedly arrested along with A3 on 14.06.1996 and at

whose   behest   certain   recoveries   were   made,   stands

acquitted by the Trial Court.      Since such an acquittal
                              40


    remains unchallenged and the role of both of them being at

     par, A3 also ought to be acquitted.
14.6 Recovery of explosives from the residence of A3 cannot
     be the sole basis of conviction:

    It is submitted that PW92, who is the sole independent

    witness to the recovery of the explosives on 15.06.1996 from

    the residence of A3, has not supported the prosecution

    case. Furthermore, as per the prosecution case, if A9 had

    made a disclosure statement on 02.06.1996, which was

    followed by the subsequent statement of PW13, the Police

    has not explained the unexplained delay in conducting a

    raid for seizing any incriminating article.
          Reliance is placed on the judgment of this Court in

    Abdulwahab Abdulmajid Balochi v. State of Gujarat,

    (2009) 11 SC 625 to state that the recovery of explosives

    from A3’s residence by itself cannot be the sole premises on

    which a judgment of conviction under Section 302 IPC could

     be recorded.
14.7 Circumstance of pointing out (Discovery of fact) is
     inadmissible under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence
     Act:

    It has been submitted that before the arrest of A3 on

    14.06.1996, the investigating agency was already aware of

    the place where the bomb was planted and where the blast
                               41


    had taken place. In such a situation, the pointing out

    (Discovery of fact) of several shops by A3 from where he had

    allegedly purchased a drill machine, gas cylinders, soldering

    iron, araldite tubes, wires and duplicate car keys is not a

    special knowledge acquired by the Police by the factum of

    pointing out.
         Furthermore, the information furnished by A3 does

    not fall within the meaning of Section 27, since it does not

    constitute information through which discovery was made,

    especially when independent witnesses to the pointing out

    memo(s) (PW33 - Mohd. Aslam, PW61 - Sumit Kumar, PW54

    - Mehmood Kamal, PW64 - Mohd. Rizwan and PW58 -

    Jitendra Pal Singh) have not supported the prosecution

    case. Hence, such an evidence cannot be relied upon for

    conviction [Himachal Pradesh Administration v. Shri Om

     Prakash, (1972) 1 SCC 249].
14.8 Disclosure statement of A3 is inadmissible           under
     Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act:

    It has been submitted that the information with respect to

    the facts discovered were already within the knowledge of

    the Police, thus, it cannot be held that the information

    supplied by A3 is the direct and immediate cause of the
                              42


    discovery. Reference is made to the judgment of this Court

    in Pulukuri Kotayya & Others v. King-Emperor (1946)

    SCC Online PC 47.

         In   any    event,   alleged   disclosure   statement

    (Exh.PW31/B) is an extract of A3’s statement recorded by

    the Police under Section 161 Cr.P.C. and not an evidence of

    the prosecution. Reference is made to judgment of this

    Court in Venkatesh Alias Chandra & Anr. v. State of

    Karnataka, 2022 SCC Online SC 765.

14.9 There is no direct evidence forthcoming about A3’s role
     in the alleged bomb blast incident:

    The case of prosecution is that the Maruti Car belonging to

    PW8 - Atul Nath was stolen and used in the bomb blast at

    Lajpat Nagar. However, this circumstance, particularly

    pointing out the place near House No. 134, Gali No. 21,

    Zakir Nagar, Delhi, where the said car was allegedly parked

    by A3, A5 and A6, has been disbelieved by the Trial Court.

    PW8 has also not supported the case of the prosecution.

    Pertinently, the High Court has set aside the conviction of

    A3 under Section 411 IPC and thereby disbelieved the

    prosecution case of A3 being in receipt of the stolen
                                43


    property. Therefore, there is no evidence to link A3 to the

    alleged offence.
14.10     Caution while dealing with a case based on
    circumstantial evidence:
    Learned Senior Counsel seeks reliance on the following

    extracted portion of the judgment in Hanumant v. State of

    M.P., (1952) SCR 1091 (2-Judge Bench) :
         “In such cases, there is always the danger that
         conjecture or suspicion may take the place of legal
         proof and therefore it is right to recall the warning
         addressed by Baron Alderson, to the jury in Reg v.
         Hodge ((1838) 2 Lew. 227), where he said:-

              "The mind was apt to take a pleasure in
              adapting circumstances to one another, and
              even in straining them a little, if need be, to
              force them to form parts of one connected whole;
              and the more ingenious the mind of the
              individual, the more likely was it, considering
              such matters to overreach and mislead itself, to
              supply some little link that is wanting, to take
              for granted some fact consistent with its
              previous theories and necessary to render them
              complete. ……..”


    and in Hari Charan Kurmi v. State of Bihar, (1964) 6 SCR

    623 :
         “As we have already indicated, it has been a
         recognised principle of the administration of criminal
         law in this country for over half a century that the
         confession of a co-accused person cannot be treated
         as substantive evidence and can be pressed into
         service only when the court is inclined to accept other
         evidence and feels the necessity of seeking for
         assurance in support of its conclusion deducible,
         from the said evidence. In criminal trials, there is no
         scope for applying the principle of moral conviction or
         grave suspicion. In criminal cases where the other
                                 44


          evidence adduced against an accused person is wholly
          unsatisfactory and the prosecution seeks to rely on
          the confession of a co-accused person, the
          presumption of innocence which is the basis of
          criminal jurisprudence assists the accused person
          and compels the Court to render the verdict that the
          charge is not proved against him, and so, he is
          entitled to the benefit of doubt. That is precisely what
          has happened in these appeals.”


14.11    The present case does not fall in the category of
    the rarest of rare cases to warrant the death penalty:

     The Appellant has undergone 27 years of imprisonment out

     of the sentence awarded to him. The occurrence of the

     incident took place on 21.05.1996, that is about 27 years

     ago. Therefore, in view of the reasons abovementioned,

     death sentence cannot be imposed particularly in view that

     the High Court while commuting the death sentence

     awarded to A3 by the Trial Court has duly held that the

     present case would not fall in the category of rarest of rare

     cases.

Submissions on behalf of A9 - Javed Ahmed Khan

15. Ms. Kamini Jaiswal, Advocate, appearing on behalf of A9 has

   placed the following submissions before this Court:
   15.1 It is submitted that the case of the prosecution is that

         on 02.06.1996, ATS Ahmedabad, Gujarat, informed
                          45


    Delhi Police about their apprehension of A9 and the

    possibility of his involvement in the Lajpat Nagar blast

    case. Thereafter, Inspector Ram Chander (PW91) along

    with his staff reached Ahmedabad on 03.06.1996.

    Contrary to this, PW91 in his statements states that

     they reached Ahmedabad on 04.06.1996.
15.2 On 15.06.1996, Rajasthan Police arrested        A9   in

    connection with FIR No.148/1996 registered under

    Sections 302, 307, 427, 120B of IPC; Section 3 of

    Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 and

    Section 4, 5 of Explosive Substances Act, 1908. This

    FIR was in connection with an incident of blast, which

    took place in Rajasthan Roadways Bus while it was on

    the way from Mahwa towards Dausa, wherein 14 people

    died and 37 were injured. It is in this case that the

    alleged confessional statement, which the prosecution

    herein seeks to rely upon, was recorded. A9 could not

    have been convicted in the instant trial as he stood

    acquitted on all counts in the case in which such a

    statement was made.
                               46


    15.3 Further, there has been no confession of A9 in the

         Lajpat Nagar bomb blast case.

Submissions on behalf of A5 and A6

16. Ms. Kamini Jaiswal, Advocate, also appearing on behalf of A5

    and A6 submits that the High Court rightly acquitted both

    the accused of all the charges, for none of the circumstances

    alleged by the prosecution are proven against them beyond

    reasonable doubt by leading cogent evidence, ocular or

    documentary.
    16.1 Reliance is placed on the judgment of this Court in

         Mousam Singha Roy v. State of West Bengal, (2003)

         12 SCC 377 (2-Judge Bench) wherein it was observed

         that it is a settled principle of criminal jurisprudence

         that more serious the offence, stricter the degree of

         proof, since a higher degree of assurance is required to

         convict the accused.
    16.2 Further reliance is placed on the judgment of this Court

         in Subramanya v. State of Karnataka, 2022 SCC

         Online SC 1400 (2-Judge Bench) on the point that in

         case of acquittal there is double presumption in favour

         of the accused and that the judgment of acquittal can
                                47


         only be set aside if it is perverse in the eyes on the

         appellate court.

Submission on behalf of the State (NCT of Delhi)

17. On the other hand, relying upon the testimonies of the

    prosecution witnesses, pointing out to the serious infirmities

    and contradictions emanating from the opinion rendered by

    the courts below, Mr. Sanjay Jain, learned Additional

    Solicitor General, vehemently argues that it is a fit case for

    intervention by this Court, since substantial errors of law

    and substantial errors in appreciation of evidence are

    discernible from the record which has resulted into grave

    miscarriage of justice. The acquittal of A5 and A6, more so

    in the light of conviction of A9, ex facie is erroneous and

    contradictory if not perverse. In a case of this nature, when

    an endeavour was made to destabilise the country, the Court

    ought to have exercised its power with due care and caution

    and considered the material in its entirety, rather than

    deciding the issues in a perfunctory manner.     Simply that

    some of the independent prosecution witnesses have not

    supported the prosecution, be it for whatever reason, cannot

    be a ground for rejecting the otherwise inspiring testimonies
                                   48


   of the police officers who had no personal interest in falsely

   implicating   the     accused        in   the   crime     in    question.

   Painstakingly, he took us through voluminous record and

   handed    over      different   notes      termed    as        “Handouts”

   (meticulously prepared by his team of young advocates)

   pointing out how the prosecution was able to establish the

   guilt of each one of the appellants beyond reasonable doubt.

   The chain of events, to prove the guilt of the accused through

   prosecution   witnesses,        as    submitted     by    the     learned

   Additional Solicitor General, is referred in such Handouts.

  Undisputed Facts


19. There are certain undisputed facts in the case at hand.

20. On 21.05.1996, at 6:30 PM, there was a bomb blast at

    Central Market, Lajpat Nagar, New Delhi. PW1, PW2, PW3,

    PW20 and PW73 are shopkeepers in Lajpat Nagar, who all

    have deposed of hearing a loud blast at around 6:30 PM;
                                52


    rushing to the spot of the blast, observing shops on fire; and

    people having sustained injuries.

21. This blast resulted in the death of 13 persons and 38 persons

    suffered injuries. PW30, PW62, PW65, PW72, and PW81

    identified dead bodies of their family members who lost their

    lives in the said bomb blast at Lajpat Nagar. PW37, PW47,

    PW51, PW53, PW56, PW57, PW70 and PW71 are doctors who

    conducted/verified the post-mortem reports of the deceased

    persons. PW10, PW15 and PW29 deposed that they were

    working in Lajpat Nagar at the time of the incident and

    suffered injuries. PW69, PW75 and PW89 are persons who

    were employed in AIIMS Hospital and assisted the above

    doctors.

22. This incident on 21.05.1996 also resulted in loss of property

    to the public. PW4, PW7, PW21, PW72 and PW84 verified the

    widespread burning of shops and vehicles in Lajpat Nagar,

    due to the blast.

23. Another proven fact is the confessional statement of A9

    -Javed Ahmed Khan in another case i.e. FIR No.39/1996 P.S.

    Gandhi Nagar, for the commission of offence under Sections

    307, 427, 120B IPC; Section 3 of Explosive Substances Act
                               53


   and Section 3 of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.

   This confessional statement was recorded under Section 164

   Cr.P.C. by an Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jaipur,

   namely Bhagwan Das (PW100) and has been verified in his

   deposition before the Trial Court.



  Brief Narration of Important Witnesses


24. We may now proceed to examine the testimonies of the

   remaining 33 prosecution witnesses (30 out of 107 have been

   discussed above), relevant to discuss the circumstances

   surrounding the present four appellants.
 24.1 PW8 – Atul Nath deposed that he is the registered owner

      of Maruti Car No.DL-2CF-5854. PW76 - Bishan, who used

      to clean the same, informed the car was missing, as such

      he filed a written Ex.PW8/A with the police. Even though

      he states that nothing was recovered in his presence from

      any person but when cross-examined, he categorically

      admits recovery of the stepney (tyre) of his car vide memo

      Ex.PW8/4 bearing his signature.
 24.2 PW11 - Nafiz in his deposition admits to have known A3,

      as he was running a shop adjacent to his shop and denies

      having any knowledge about the case or having made any
                                54


    statement to the police and also having seen A3 on

    14.05.1996 getting a hole drilled in a gas cylinder. Hence,

     he deposed the police having brought A3 near his shop.
24.3 PW13 Mohd. Wajid, is the person in whose house A9 had

    delivered the bag full of RDX.             In Court, the witness

    denies having known anyone of the accused, be it A3, A5,

    A6 or A9. He denies having known A4 and A5 for the last

    5-6 years or having met anyone of the accused persons in

    connection with the sale of shawls. He denies having any

    relationship,   be   that   of     landlord-tenant     or    social/

    matrimonial, with them. He denies anyone of the accused

    having stayed in his house in connection with the crime.

    Unrefutedly, he was confronted with his prior statement

    made to the police, stating the aforesaid facts, which was

    marked as Mark A in deposition.             Also significantly, his

    denial stands belied by the deposition of PW101, who

    admits to have recorded the statement as made by this

    witness and as put to him in his examination-in-chief,

    marked as Ex.Mark A2. Here only we may record the

    witness   not   to   have        deposed    the   truth     for   the
                            55


    circumstances of the witness staying at Turkman Gate

     was accepted by the courts below.
24.4 The deposition of PW14 - Pappi is to similar effect and

     lines as that of PW13.
24.5 PW16 - Inspector Rajender Gautam in his deposition

    states that on 14.06.1996, he joined the investigation with

    Inspector Paras Nath, Inspector Suresh Chander and SI

    Surender Verma. At around 6:30 PM, Inspector Paras

    Nath received secret information that A3, involved in the

    commission of this case, along with a Kashmiri youth,

    would be going to Gorakhpur via Vaishali Express. The

    police party reached New Delhi Railway Station where

    they were joined by ACP P.P. Singh. At 7:30 PM, after

    pointing out by an informer at Platform No. 4, A3 and A4

    were arrested. Hence, in Court the witness was able to

    correctly identify both of them.
       Further, during interrogation     A4   and   A3   made

  disclosure statements admitting their guilt marked as

  Ex.PW16/C and Ex.PW16/D respectively, which bear his

  signature. A3 and A4 also disclosed the names of their

  associates including A5 - Naza, A9 - Javed and Riaz Mulla.

  Even though, the witness was declared hostile but in his
                             56


cross-examination part, he admits that on 16.06.1996, A6

and A7 were arrested, and searched vide search memos vide

Ex.PW16/D and Ex.PW16/E which bear his signatures. He

further states that a Rs.2 note was recovered from A7, to be

used for collecting Rs.1 Lakh from one Mangal Chand from

Shalimar Bagh.      A6 and A7 made disclosure statements

bearing his signatures vide Ex. PW16/H and Ex.PW16/I.

Accused A5 pointed out the shop bearing No.3/32 Bhogal

vide memo        Ex.PW16/K    to   the    effect   that    after   the

unsuccessful      bomb   blast     the     said     accused        had

telephonically    informed   A7    at    Kathmandu        about    the

unsuccessful bomb blast. Also A6 pointed out shop No. C-

1/59, Lajpat Nagar vide Ex.PW16/B which bears his

signature.
     In his cross examination by the accused, he has

deposed of the circumstances pertaining to the arrest of A3.

Categorically he states that Inspector Paras Nath had

requested about 7/8 persons to join the investigation, but

none volunteered. He denies the factum of A3 being picked

up from his house by the police on the intervening night of

28/29.05.1996.
                             57


24.6 PW17 - Sub Inspector Sanjay Kumar in his deposition

    states that on 17.06.1996 he joined investigation of this

    case along with Inspector Paras Nath by then A3, A5 and

    A6 were already in the police custody. The said accused

    accompanied the police party and pointed out (Discovery

    of fact) the house belonging to A8 at Jangpura from where

    stepney (tyre) of the car was recovered vide Ex.PW8/B

    bearing his signature. This stepney (tyre) was identified by

    PW8 and the Investigating Officer (‘IO’) prepared an

    identification memo Ex.PW8/C, which also bears his

    signature. Also a bag containing some documents and

    clothes was recovered vide memo Ex.PW17/A.
         After the investigation was finished at Jangpura,

    Bhogal, they proceeded to Shalimar Bagh, where Raj

    Kumar (independent witness) was added to the raiding

    party. The police party along with A4 proceeded to the

    place of Mangal Chand where with the handing over

    currency note of Rs.2, Rs.1 lakh wrapped in a polythene

    was given, which he referred to as the hawala money. The

    currency notes were seized vide memo Ex.PW17/C, which

    bears his signature.
                             58
           Further on 27.06.1996 he, along with Inspector

    Jagmal Singh, recovered explosives weighing 500gms, two

    detonators and some other articles from the house of A6

    vide Ex.PW/17F, which bears his signature.             Also

    recovered two IEDs from the house of A7 vide Ex.PW17G,

    bearing his signature. From the residence of A5, they

    recovered a hand grenade vide Ex.PW17/H, which also

     bears his signature. He identified the accused in Court.
24.7 PW23 - Inspector Puran Singh deposed that on

     17.06.1996 he had gone to Mussoorie, where he arrested

     A5 from Minerva Hotel and brought him to Delhi where,

     under interrogation, he made a disclosure statement vide

     Ex.PW23/B, which was also signed by him. Significantly

     the witness denies having picked up the said accused

     from Sanoli Borders at Nepal.
24.8 PW31 Inspector Surinder Kumar has deposed that on

     15.06.1996 he joined the investigation, and A3 took the

     police party to his residence at Turkman Gate from where

     two RDX slabs weighing 1kg 150gms; Jayco alarm time

     piece with two wires coming out of it; one detonator with

     wire; one iron solder; one screwdriver; two araldite tubes;

     one gas cylinder and certain other articles were recovered
                           59


  vide memo Ex.PW31/A, bearing his signature and also of

  independent witness PW92 - Abdul Samad. Disclosure

  statement of A3 recorded vide memo Ex.PW31/B also

  bears his signatures. On 17.06.1996, A3 pointed out the

  place from where he had purchased the gas cylinder; on

  18.06.1996, A3, A5 and A6 took the police party to Raja

  Number Plate, (maker of the duplicate number plate) at

  Connaught Place; Deluxe Store in Meena Bazar from

  where araldite tube was purchased; A cable shop named

  Unistar Cable; and got recovered a drill machine from a

  fan shop seized vide Ex. PW31/C, bearing his signature.

     After pointing out memos were prepared, A3, A5 and

A6 took the police party to Nizamuddin, where one stepney

(tyre) was recovered from the residence of A8 as identified by

the owner of the car, PW8 - Atul. A8 was also arrested at

the time of this recovery. On 18.06.1996, the accused got

recovered the original front number plate of the stated

vehicle from a place known as Mehal Khander vide

Ex.PW31/D and the rear original number plate recovered

from the place opposite to Oberoi hotel vide Ex.PW31/E,

bearing his signatures.
                            60
     On 18.06.1996, the accused also pointed out (got

identified): (i) the location where the stolen car was parked

at Zakir Nagar; (ii) the Dulhan Rangrej Shop where on

19.05.1996, they parked the car loaded with RDX but did

not explode due to weak battery; and (iii) the location where

they parked the car on the day of the blast.

     On 19.06.1996, A5 and A6 pointed out (got identified):

(i) Ganesh Electronics where the 9 volt battery to be used in

the blast was purchased. The owner of this shop also

identified the accused persons; (ii) Vijay Electronics from

where the wires to fix the battery was purchased; (iii)

Imperial Gramaphone Company where Jayco alarm piece

was bought vide Bill Ex.PW31/G; (iv) Unique Agency where

the gas cylinder was purchased; and (v) The shop from

     Pointing out memos, Ex.PW31/J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q,

R, S, T and U of the above locations were recorded

separately with each one bearing his signatures. In court,

he identified each one of the seized articles as also its

respective place of recovery.
                            61


24.9 PW32 - Mohd. Naseem [owner of shop where A3 and A5

    allegedly purchased wire] who turned hostile denies that

    A3 and A5 purchased a wire from his shop on 13.05.1996

    and stated that police obtained his thumb impression on a

    piece of paper but he is not aware of its contents.

     (pg.1019)
24.10 PW33 - Mohd. Aslam [shop owner from where allegedly

    drill machine was purchased] is the owner of Unistar Fans

    at Meena Bazar and admits to have known A3 as his

    neighbour.   Though, he denies A3 having made any

    purchases from him, or the police recovered any bill book,

    but admits recovery of a drilling machine.     Though, he

    denies having signed any recovery memo Ex.PW31/C but

    does not specifically state, as the accused wants the Court

    to believe, of the same being prepared as the paper

     allegedly signed blank by him.
24.11 PW39 - Inspector Hari Ram Malik was posted in the

    Operation Cell, Lodi Colony, when A1 and A2 made their

    disclosure statements, also bearing his signatures. He

    joined the investigation     on various    dates including

    14.06.1996   along   with    Inspector    Suresh   Chander,

    Inspector Rajinder Gautam, SI Surinder Verma, SI
                             62


    Virender Singh, SI Arvind Verma and Omkar Singh.

    Effectively, rather he corroborates PW31 that he has

    witnessed the arrest of A3 and A4 from New Delhi Railway

    Station on 14.06.1996. Such version is on similar lines

    as deposed by PW16. He also corroborates the factum of

    A3 and A4 admitting their involvement in this case.
         He corroborates the version of PW31 on pointing out

    (Discovery of fact) of several locations by A3, A4 and A5 on

    18.06.1996 & 19.06.1996.
         He admits that no witness from the neighbouring

    shops was joined during the pointing out proceedings, nor

    was site plan prepared. Also no public witness was joined

    at the time of the recovery of the number plates. However,

    in view of his unrebutted testimony fully inspiring

    confidence, such a fact would not render the investigation

    to be flawed or in any manner weaken the prosecution

     case.
24.12 PW40 - Sub Inspector Baljit Singh stated that he

    travelled to Gorakhpur on 18.06.1996. He obtained

    photocopy of reservation chart of Saheed Express from

    Gorakhpur to New Delhi dated 27.05.1996 (Ex.PW40/A),
                                 63


    bearing A3’s name. He then visited Gupta Hotel and

    obtained photocopy of the visitors’ book (Ex.PW40/C).
       On 28.06.1996 he again visited Gorakhpur for

    recovery   of    visitors’    register    from   Gupta   Hotel

    (Ex.PW40/E) and Budha Hotel (Ex.PW40/F), where A3

    had stayed.     In his cross-examination he stated that he

    had not obtained any evidence to show that Naushad got

    reserved the ticket from Gorakhpur to New Delhi. He

    further stated that he does not remember the DD

    numbers of his visits to Gorakhpur.         But then this fact

    would not render the veracity of his statement to be in any

     manner doubtful.
24.13 PW41 Suresh          Chander      has    deposed   that   on

    15.06.1996, A3 took the police party to his residence. In

    terms of disclosure statement Ex.PW31/B made by A3,

    certain facts were discovered at his residence in terms of

    recovery of incriminating material, i.e., (i) One bag

    containing two RDX bricks, which, when weighed, were of

    1 kg 150 gms. The same were sealed with the seal ‘PP’

    and the packet (Pulanda) given No.1; (ii) One casio quartz

    watch (Japan), which also was sealed and the packet

    (Pulanda) marked as No.2; (iii) One bag containing iron
                        64


solder; wires of two colours; araldite tubes; screwdriver

and black colour wire; which was sealed and the packet

given No.3; (iv) One illumination detonator having two

wires which was sealed and the packet given No.4; and (v)

one green colour gas cylinder which also was sealed. The

recoveries were effected vide memo Ex.PW31/A.           He

testified the signatures put both on the disclosure

statement as also on the memo of recoveries.
   The sealed articles were opened and resealed in the

Court. The articles opened were testified to be the very

same which were sealed. Significantly, save and except for

the accused-A8, none had cross-examined the witness on

any issue. When we perused the cross-examination part

of the testimony of this witness, as conducted on behalf of

A8, we find the endeavour to impeach the credibility of the

witness was primarily on the ground of non-association of

independent witnesses. However, despite extensive cross-

examination running into four pages, we find the witness

to have stuck to the original version and that being:

different places where the search was conducted; the

factum of disclosure statement made by the accused;
                               65
    places where search was conducted as a result thereof,

    including Flat No.P-7, DDA Flats, Turkman Gate, Delhi; on

    the   asking   of   this   accused   and   recovery   of   the

    incriminating articles referred to in the earlier part of

    testimonies.   No doubt the witness admits not to have

    associated any person from the neighbourhood but then a

    reasonable explanation thereto is given by him that save

    and except for one witness, namely, Abdul Samad (PW 92)

    also a resident of Turkman Gate, none else volunteered to

     join the investigation.
24.14 PW43 - Inspector Virender Singh has deposed of his

    visit to Satyam Hotel, Paharganj on 07.06.1996. However

    effective his deposition is, as the factum of his visit to

    Mussoorie along with PW23 when A5 was arrested and

    brought to Delhi where his disclosure statement vide

     Ex.PW23/B was recorded bearing his signatures.
24.15 PW46 - Rajan Arora, the owner of Satyam Hotel,

    Paharganj, categorically identified A9, who had stayed in

    his hotel on 14.05.1996 along with one Nepalese boy for

     one day in either room No.104 or 106.
24.16 PW48 - Pramod Kumar was working as an employee at

    the Imperial Gramophone Company in Chandni Chawk.
                             66


    He admits to have sold one Jayco alarm wall clock for a

    sum of Rs.182. This was approximately 8-9 years prior to

    his deposition which was on 21.05.2004.         He admits to

    have issued receipt Ex.PW 48/A bearing his signatures.

    No doubt this witness has not supported the prosecution

    on the aspect of identification of anyone of the accused,

    i.e., A5 and A6, who had allegedly purchased the said

    clock but however, on the material aspect of the sale of the

    clock he fully supports the prosecution, which version of

    his stands fully corroborated with material fact by his

    employer, namely, PW50 - Yogesh Kumar who identifies

     the purchases of clock to be made by A5 and A6.
24.17 PW50 - Yogesh Kumar Gupta, owner of Imperial

    Gramophone Company has deposed that on 04.05.1996,

    the Kashmiri looking boys had purchased Jayco wall clock

    from his sales man Pramod. After a period of 20-22 days,

    police had got identified such persons. In Court he admits

    pointing memo, i.e., discovery of fact to have been signed

    by him. His explanation in clearly not identifying A5 and

    A6 is quite plausible for as explained by him, such

    transaction   took   place    several   years   prior   to   his
                            67


    deposition.   However, there is no categorical denial of

    these persons having visited the shop for purchasing the

    articles or having identified the place and the shop where

     the police visited.
24.18 PW52 - Mohd. Alam is the owner of Deluxe Store,

    Jama Masjid and not supported the prosecution. He

    states that 8-9 years ago, when some persons had

    enquired about purchase of araldite, he answered that he

    does not remember any specific instances as several

    customers come to his shop. He further states that his

    statement may have been recorded. In this cross-

    examination by the public prosecution, he denies making

    a statement to police which was read over to him marked

    as Ex.PW52/A. He further denies pointing out of his shop

    by A3 and A5 on 18.06.1996. He further denies that it is

    not the case that he is unable to identify the accused due

     to lapse of time.
24.19 PW54 - Mahmood Karnul was running a gas agency,

    namely, Unique Agencies. In his deposition he stated that

    in 05.1996, two persons had come to his shop to

    purchase gas cylinder from whom he took deposit of

    Rs.290 and asked them to collect the cylinder the next
                            68


    day. He further states that on 19.06.1996, police officials

    came and took him to their office at Lodhi Colony. He

    denies the accused to have purchased the same but

     admits his signatures on the pointing out memo Ex.31/M.
24.20 PW58 - Mr. Jitendra Pal Singh is the owner of Imperial

    Sound and Services.    He has deposed that two persons

    had purchased one soldering iron and solder for a sum of

    Rs.35.   On 19.6.1996, the police visited his shop along

    with two persons whose faces were muffled.       The shop

    was identified by them by way of pointing out memo

    Ex.PW31/K which bears his signatures.            Also, he

    identified the articles sold by him. However, with regard

    to the identification of the accused he categorically does

    not deny that the two persons brought by the police were

    the persons who had purchased the articles but in fact

     states that “may be one of them” was A3.
24.21 PW - 60 Rajesh Kumar is the owner of M/s. Ganesh

    Electricals. In his deposition he categorically states that

    on 29.05.1996 two persons had purchased 9 volt battery

    make of ‘Entiser’ for a sum of Rs.95/-. On 19.06.1996 two

    persons accompanied by the police party, identified his

    shop and the place from where they had purchased the
                            69


    battery. Ex.PW31/L is such identification memo which

    bears his signatures. On account of passage of time, as

    his deposition was recorded on 05.10.2004, he could not

    specifically deny the two persons brought by the police to

    be the one who had not purchased the batteries but in

    fact admits having informed the police of one of them

     being A5.
24.22 PW - 61 Sumit Kumar is the owner of the shop named

    as “Dulhan Dupatta” situated at Lajpat Nagar, Delhi in the

    premises at D2D-35, Lajpat Nagar, Delhi. He admits that

    one Saturday, in the afternoon, when 3-4 persons had

    parked a white Maruti 800 car in front of his shop, he

    objected and as such the vehicle was removed and parked

    in front of the doctor’s shop. He remembered the

    registration number of car to be 1895. Two days thereafter

    he learnt that the bomb blast had taken place in the said

    car. While he was away, the police party visited his shop

    and made enquiry from his brother. Even though the

    witness turned hostile and cross-examined by the public

    prosecutor, however, from the cross-examination part of

    his testimony it is evident that the accused accompanying
                               70


     the police had identified his shop, being the place where

     they had parked the vehicle, vide pointing out memo

     Ex.PW31/R, which bears his signatures.        He admits to

     have correctly identified A3 with certainty and A5 with a

     degree of little doubt; categorically he denies the identity

     of third accused i.e. A6. Be that as it may, it is evident

     from his testimony that he has raised objection for the

     parking of the vehicle and the accused had quarrelled

     with him. He further admits which version of his is

     unrefuted that on 20.05.1996, the vehicle was found not

     parked at the place where it was so done by the accused.
24.23 PW64 - Mohd. Rizwan admits that few persons had

     come to him for getting a car key made which he did. He

     does not remember the exact date nor identify the said

     persons on account of passage of time but on cross-

     examination by the Public Prosecutor, he identifies his

     signature on the pointing out memo Ex.PW31/J.
24.24 PW - 67 Keshar Singh is an employee of Royal Nepal

     Air   Lines.   He   has   categorically   proved   document

     Ex.PW67/A, the passenger manifest indicating the name

     of A5 who travelled from Kathmandu to Delhi on

     10.05.1996.
                             71


24.25   PW - 76 Bishan Kumar, was engaged by PW8 for

    cleaning the car used in the bomb blast. He fully

    corroborated the version of the car being stolen and on

    17.05.1996 having noticed “the door” (cap) of the petrol

     tank of the car missing.
24.26 PW82 - Daya Shanker Lal Gupta is the owner of Hotel

    where prior to his arrest A3 had stayed at Gorakhpur. He

    deposed that on 18.06.1996, two police officers had taken

    photocopies of his visitors’ book vide Ex.PW40/D bearing

    his signatures. He testified that there is entry by the name

    of A3 who had stayed in his hotel on 27.05.1996.

     (pg.2093)
24.27 PW83 - Vijay Kumar Manager of Gupta Hotel has

    testified that A3 stayed at the hotel in Room No.14 on

     27.05.1996.
24.28 PW91 - Inspector Ram Chander in his deposition

    stated that on 02.06.1996, information was received

    through a TPT message (Ex.PW 91/A and 91/B) from ATS

    Ahmedabad disclosing that some terrorists involved in the

    bomb blast at Lajpat Nagar have been arrested at

    Ahmedabad. He was sent to Ahmedabad for conducting

    interrogation. He correctly identifies A9 and A10 in Court
                                  72


    on the date of his deposition. He further states that in his

    interrogation A9 stated that he was given a military colour

    bag containing RDX and detonators by A7 - Latif, which

    he was asked to hand over to A5 - Naza at the residence of

     PW13 at Turkman Gate, Delhi.
24.29 PW - 92 Abdul Samad                      was   examined      by   the

    prosecution to prove recovery memo Ex.PW31/A recovered

    from the residence of A3. However, in Court while not

    supporting the prosecution on all counts he comes out

    with a different version of the said accused being picked

    up   by   the      police     in     the    intervening     night    of

    28/29.05.1996. He comes out with a new version of the

    recovery not being effected in his presence and “3-4 days

    later” he was called to the police station Lodhi Road and

    made to sign document Ex.PW31/A, which was partly

    written, but contents thereof, not read out to him, as he is

    not literate. Significantly, perhaps the finding that the

    witness not to have deposed truthfully for helping his

    neighbour,   the     Public        Prosecutor    extensively    cross-

    examined him. All the circumstances relating to the event

    of search, seizure and recovery of the incriminating
                             73


    material including RDX was put to the witness to which

    he denied. Having perused the record, it is our view that

    the apprehension of the learned Public Prosecutor is

    fortified from the record itself for the document memo

    Ex.PW31/A is signed and not thumb impressed and that

    too in English language. Thus, his version that he is

    illiterate is, ex-facie, false. That apart as already noticed

    earlier, the witness who is examined in Court on

    08.02.2005 remained silent for a period of 9 years. His

    version of A3 being picked up as he wants the Court to

    believe, is nowhere supported by anyone of the witnesses.

    Equally, he did not take any steps informing any person of

    such fact, thus rendering his own version to this effect to

     be unbelievable.
24.30 PW98 - B.R. Patil, DSP ATS Ahmedabad has deposed

    that on suspicion he interrogated four persons who

    disclosed their name as Asdullah, Rashid Ahmad, Javed

    Khan and Juber Bhatt. Whereafter, he lodged report, for

    he had knowledge that at least two persons, namely,

    Asdullah and Rashid Ahmad, had come from Nepal to

    Ahmedabad for causing bomb explosions. On arrest, he
                             74


    recovered certain incriminating material from Asdullah

    which was seized. The witness categorically identifies A9

    and A10 to be amongst those whom he had interrogated

     and arrested.
24.31 PW99 - Inspector B.M. Rajvanshi deposed that he was

    posted in Anti-Terrorist Squad at Ahmedabad, Gujarat. On

    23.05.1996, he was ordered by DGP to enquire into

    information received, of A10 and Rashid having entered

    India from Kathmandu to perform blasts in Ahmedabad.

    On 25.06.1996, SI Waghela and the police party were in

    search for the above-mentioned persons and found one

    relevant entry in the register of Anukul Guest House. They

    left the hotel on 25.06.1996 and continued the search.

    The police party found 4 suspicious persons near Rupali

    Season and after enquiry they were brought to the ATS

    Office, Ahmedabad. He conducted personal search and

    received digital diary, suspicious literature etc, which were

    seized by him on 01.06.1996.
          During further investigation, A10 disclosed that

     under the guise of Jammu and Kashmir Islamic Front, it

     was planned in March/April 1996 to sabotage India and

     A10 would supervise the same. Thereafter, A10 sent A9
                            75


     with 8/9kgs of explosives to Delhi, who gave the same to

     the sister of Wajid Kasai (PW13). A5 came from Nepal

     and with his colleagues he committed one bomb blast in

     Lajpat Nagar Market on 21.05.1996. PW99 further stated

     that A10 and A9 both disclosed that they were involved

     in the Lajpat Nagar blast case. Disclosure Statement of

     A9 is marked as Ex.PW99/B and A10 is marked is

     Ex.PW99/A.
24.32 PW101 - Inspector Paras Nath is the main officer who

    conducted the investigation.     He was posted as an

    Inspector in the Special Cell of the Delhi Police. In Court

    he states that under the orders of the Commissioner of

    Delhi Police the case was transferred from South District

    to Special Cell, whereafter he took over the investigation.

    Then custody of accused Farida Dar and Farooq Ahmed

    was entrusted to him. On 2.6.1996, he was informed that

    accused A9 - Javed Ahmed Khan and A10 - Abdul Gani

    had made a disclosure statement and revealed certain

    information to the police at Ahmedabad of having

    delivered 8 kgs of RDX at the residence of one Wajid

    Kasai, a resident of Turkman Gate, whereafter on making
                          76


inquiries he was able to trace the place where the RDX

was delivered. Soon in the presence of ACP, Wajid Kasai

was interrogated who informed that he knew A9 through

A3. Since the room of A3 was locked, the place was kept

under surveillance, waiting for the occupant to return.

On 14.6.1996, the police party arrested A3 from New

Delhi Railway Station, for, as per information, the said

accused was to board the train from New Delhi to

Gorakhpur.    Under interrogation A3 made a disclosure

statement of having kept certain incriminating material at

his house which led to discovery of fact, i.e., identification

of the house, the place where A3 had kept the said

material and the recovery of the leftover articles for

preparing bomb. The articles were recovered vide memo

Ex.PW31/A      pursuant    to   the   disclosure   statement

PW16/C/B.      Pursuant to the information received, he

deputed two police parties - one to visit Gorakhpur and

another to visit Mussoorie for nabbing A6 and A7 from

Gorakhpur and A5 at the respective places.          The said

accused persons were arrested and brought to Delhi,

whereafter all the accused made disclosure statements
                       77


narrating as to how they had planned and executed the

blast which had taken place at the Central Market Lajpat

Nagar on 21.5.1996. By that time police got aware that

RDX was carried for blast in Delhi by A9 from Kathmandu

to Delhi and all the accused persons had conspired to

carry out such blast. The preparation for the blast and

carrying out the same was brought to knowledge of the

police through the recovery and pointing out in the

following chain of circumstances :-
 (i)    Recovery of the stepney of the vehicle stolen by
        the accused

In pursuance of the separate disclosure statements made

by A3, A5 and A6, the police party was led to premises

statement Ex.PW 17/I where he stated that stepney was

given by A5 and that the said stepney belonged to the car

in which bomb blast was carried out at Lajpat Nagar.
                        78
ii) Recovery of one lakh rupees from Mangal Chand

When A6 and A7 were arrested by Inspector Rajeshwar,

Rs.2 note was recovered from the possession of A7 and on

   j)   All accused persons pointed out the place where

        duplicate key was thrown after the successful blast,

        i.e. behind bus stop Nizamuddin ITI. This key was

        recovered and sealed vide pointing out-cum-recovery

        memo Ex. PW31/F.
   k)   A5 and A6 pointed out the place of occurrence i.e.

        Pushpa Market Lajpat Nagar near Fountain Park Car

        Parking vide pointing out memo Ex.PW31/T.

   On 26.06.1996, Inspector Jagmal Singh along with his

team took A5, A6 and A7 to Srinagar for further recovery and

returned on 30.06.1996. On 26.07.1996, A9 and A10 were

brought to Delhi and their disclosure statements were

recorded separately vide Ex.PW18/F and Ex.PW101/A. On

04.08.1996, A9 pointed out the Hotel where he along with his

associate stayed on 14.05.1996 vide pointing out memo

Ex.PW24/B.
                            81


   A5 pointed out Shop No.3/32 situated at Bhogal, Delhi

and informed the police party that he had made a telephonic

call to A7 at Kathmandu on 19.5.1996 vide pointing out

memo Ex.PW 16/A. The witnesses had identified the articles

recovered by the police and proven on record, more

specifically recovered vide various memos.

   The witness stood extensively cross-examined, however,

the endeavour was to impeach his credit, more so with

respect to A1 and A2, which is evident from the first four

pages of the cross-examination part of his testimony.

Significantly, on the issue of A3 being taken into custody

prior to 14.6.1996, the witness has withstood the test of

scrutiny, being cross-examined very extensively, for it not to

be so.   Further, his credit is sought to be impeached by

inquiring questions as to why Mangal Chand and PW-13 were

not arrayed as accused to which his response is cogent and

clear for him to have passed on the information to the

appropriate authorities dealing with the relevant laws.    No

doubt the witness attempts not to have obtained the opinion

of the experts as to whether the cylinder would have been

drilled or not but then this fact alone would not negate the
                               82


 prosecution case for it is not a suggested case of the accused

 that the blast carried out was not with the use of RDX, which

 was not readily available in the market and which was, in

 fact, used, as has come out in the testimony of the other

 witnesses for making the bomb, if on the issue of the

 material collected against the accused, pertaining to their

 State and travelled at different places, stands duly proven by

 this witness. Also, scientific evidence does establish party of

 cylinder collected from the site to have traces of RDX.

24.33     PW105 - ACP P.P. Singh was the in-charge of the

    operation in Special Cell of Delhi Police at the relevant

    point of time.     As per his version, the investigation was

    transferred to the Special Cell on 26.5.1996 and it is he

     who entrusted the same to Paras Nath PW101.
24.34 At this juncture, we may only reiterate that post-

        recording of 313 statement of the accused, only A3

        examined two witnesses, i.e, DW-1, namely, Mukesh, the

        Section Officer of the Human Rights Commission, New

        Delhi (pg.4015) and DW 2, namely, Arun Kumar Sharma,

        Public Relation Officer, GPO, New Delhi.
                                83
         The witnesses have deposed nothing save and except

     for complaint purportedly written by the father of A3 sent

     through    an   ordinary   post   to   the   Human     Rights

     Commission. Here only we may add that the witnesses, in

     any manner, falsify the stand of the prosecution for neither

     the father nor any other independent witnesses stand

     examined proving the alleged letter purportedly written by

     the father or the factum of the accused having been

     illegally detained or arrested prior to 14.6.1996.

 25. We must now examine the circumstances which the

      prosecution seeks to rely on, to establish the guilt of the

      Appellants herein.

  Opinion of this Court

26. We now proceed to examine the various charges as

   enumerated above faced by the accused person, namely

   Mohd. Naushad (A3), Mirza Nissar Ahmed @Naza (A5), Mohd.

   Ali Bhatt @ Killey (A6) and Javed Ahmed Khan (A9).

27. It is incumbent upon the prosecution to establish that the

   accused persons agreed to do an illegal act or an act by illegal

   means as part of the conspiracy and thereby caused the
                                     84


      death or attempted to cause the death of persons. Also, if the

      accused person received or retained a stolen property, in this

      case, the Maruti car; or if intentionally or knowingly caused

      wrongful loss or damage to the public or any person by use of

      fire or explosive substance.


28. The present case is based on circumstantial evidence.


29. Firstly, we proceed to examine the law on the issue of

      Circumstantial Evidence.


30.     A Constitution Bench of this Court in M.G. Agarwal v.

      State of Maharashtra (1963) 2 SCR 405 (5-Judge Bench)

      has observed as under:

         “…It is a well-established rule in criminal jurisprudence
         that circumstantial evidence can be reasonably made the
         basis of an accused person's conviction if it is of such a
         character that it is wholly inconsistent with the
         innocence of the accused and is consistent only with his
         guilt. If the circumstances proved in the case are
         consistent either with the innocence of the accused or
         with his guilt, then the accused is entitled to the benefit
         of doubt. There is no doubt or dispute about this
         position. But in applying this principle, it is necessary to
         distinguish between facts which may be called primary
         or basic on the one hand and inference of facts to be
         drawn from them on the other. In regard to the proof of
         basic or primary facts, the court has to judge the
         evidence in the ordinary way, and in the appreciation of
         evidence in respect of the proof of these basic or primary
         facts there is no scope for the application of the doctrine
                                  85


       of benefit of doubt. The court considers the evidence and
       decides whether that evidence proves a particular fact or
       not. When it is held that a certain fact is proved, the
       question arises whether that fact leads to the inference
       of guilt of the accused person or not, and in dealing with
       this aspect of the problem, the doctrine of benefit of
       doubt would apply and an inference of guilt can be
       drawn only if the proved fact is wholly inconsistent with
       the innocence of the accused and is consistent only with
       his guilt. It is in the light of this legal position that the
       evidence in the present case has to be appreciated.”


31. Further, on the point of as to whether the accused persons

   can be convicted or not on the basis of circumstantial

   evidence is now evidently clear and we need not dilate on the

   issue any further, save and except refer to the five golden

   principles curled out by this Court in Sharad Birdhichand

   Sarda v. State of Maharashtra, (1984) 4 SCC 116 (3-Judge

   Bench) which must be fulfilled before a case against an

   accused can be said to be fully established on circumstantial

   evidence:


    “(1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is
    to be drawn should be fully established.
    (2) the facts so established should be consistent only with
    the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they
    should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except
    that the accused is guilty,
    (3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and
    tendency
    (4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the
    one to be proved, and
                                86


    (5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to
    leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent
    with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all
    human probability, the act must have been done by the
    accused.”

32. On this point, the judgment of this Court in Mohd. Arif v.

   State (NCT of Delhi), (2011) 13 SCC 621, (2-Judge Bench),

   is also of relevance, wherein it has been observed:

       “190. There can be no dispute that in a case entirely
       dependent on the circumstantial evidence, the
       responsibility of the prosecution is more as compared to
       the case where the ocular testimony or the direct
       evidence, as the case may be, is available. The Court,
       before relying on the circumstantial evidence and
       convicting the accused thereby has to satisfy itself
       completely that there is no other inference consistent
       with the innocence of the accused possible nor is there
       any plausible explanation. The Court must, therefore,
                                  87


        make up its mind about the inferences to be drawn from
        each proved circumstance and should also consider the
        cumulative effect thereof. In doing this, the Court has to
        satisfy its conscience that it is not proceeding on the
        imaginary inferences or its prejudices and that there
        could be no other inference possible excepting the guilt
        on the part of the accused.

        191. …. At times, there may be only a few
        circumstances available to reach a conclusion of the
        guilt on the part of the accused and at times, even if
        there are large numbers of circumstances proved, they
        may not be enough to reach the conclusion of guilt on
        the part of the accused. It is the quality of each
        individual circumstance that is material and that would
        essentially depend upon the quality of evidence. Fanciful
        imagination in such cases has no place. Clear and
        irrefutable logic would be an essential factor in arriving
        at the verdict of guilt on the basis of the proven
        circumstances.”
                                           (emphasis supplied)


33. Since the prosecution case rests on discovery of facts, we

    deem it appropriate to discuss the legal position.

34. What is the meaning of the expression ‘fact discovered’ under

    Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act has been settled by the

    Privy Council in Kottaya v. Emperor AIR 1947 PC 67 (5-

    Judge Bench), way back in the year 1947:

          “The condition necessary to bring the section into
          operation is that discovery of a fact in consequence
          of information received from a person accused of any
          offence in the custody of a Police Officer must be
          deposed to, and thereupon so much of the
          information as release distinctly to the fact thereby
          discovered may be proved. The section seems to be
                             88


     based on the view that if a fact is actually discovered
     in consequence of information given, some guarantee
     is afforded thereby that the information was true,
     and accordingly can be safely allowed to be given in
     evidence; but clearly the extent of the information
     admissible must depend on the exact nature of the
     fact discovered to which such information is required
     to relate. ….

     … fact discovered embraces the place from which the
     object is produced and the knowledge of the accused
     as to this, and the information given must relate
     distinctly to this fact. Information as to the past user,
     or the past history, of the object produced is not
     related to its discovery in the setting in which it is
     discovered. Information supplied by a person in
     custody that “I will produce a knife concealed in the
     roof of my house” does not lead to the discovery of a
     knife; knives were discovered many years ago. It
     leads to the discovery of the fact that a knife is
     concealed in the house of the informant to his
     knowledge, and if the knife is proved to have been
     used in the commission of the offence, the fact
     discovered is very relevant. But if to the statement
     words be added “with which I stabbed A” these words
     are inadmissible since they do not relate to the
     discovery of the knife in the house of the informant.”
                                          (Emphasis supplied)

35. Conspiracy being a major charge, we take note of the legal

   position on the point of conspiracy between accused persons,

   we place reliance on the judgment of this Court in Kehar

   Singh & Ors. v. State (Delhi Administration), (1988) 3

   SCC 609 (3- Judge Bench), wherein this Court observed:

         “271. Before considering the other matters against
      Balbir Singh, it will be useful to consider the concept of
      criminal conspiracy under Sections 120-A and 120-B of
      IPC. These provisions have brought the Law of
      Conspiracy in India in line with the English law by
      making the overt act unessential when the conspiracy is
      to commit any punishable offence. The English law on
      this matter is well settled. The following passage
      from Russell on Crime (12th Edn., Vol. I, p. 202) may be
      usefully noted:

         “The gist of the offence of conspiracy then lies, not in
         doing the act, or effecting the purpose for which the
         conspiracy is formed, nor in attempting to do them,
         nor in inciting others to do them, but in the forming
         of the scheme or agreement between the parties.
         Agreement is essential. Mere knowledge, or even
         discussion, of the plan is not, per se, enough.”

         272. Glanville Williams in the Criminal Law (2nd
         Edn., p. 382) explains the proposition with an
         illustration:

               “The question arose in an Iowa case, but it was
               discussed in terms of conspiracy rather than of
               accessoryship. D, who had a grievance against
               P, told E that if he would whip P someone
               would pay his fine. E replied that he did not
               want anyone to pay his fine, that he had a
               grievance of his own against P and that he
               would whip him at the first opportunity. E
               whipped P. D was acquitted of conspiracy
                         90


      because there was no agreement for ‘concert of
      action’, no agreement to ‘co-operate’.”

273. Coleridge, J., while summing up the case to jury
in Regina v. Murphy [173 ER 508] (173 Eng. Reports
508) pertinently states:

      “I am bound to tell you, that although the
      common design is the root of the charge, it is
      not necessary to prove that these two parties
      came together and actually agreed in terms to
      have this common design and to pursue it by
      common means, and so to carry it into
      execution. This is not necessary, because in
      many cases of the most clearly established
      conspiracies there are no means of proving any
      such thing, and neither law nor common sense
      requires that it should be proved. If you find
      that these two persons pursued by their acts
      the same object, often by the same means, one
      performing one part of an act, so as to
      complete it, with a view to the attainment of
      the object which they were pursuing, you will
      be at liberty to draw the conclusion that they
      have been engaged in a conspiracy to effect that
      object. The question you have to ask yourselves
      is, ‘Had they this common design, and did they
      pursue it by these common means — the
      design being unlawful?’ ”

274. It will be thus seen that the most important
ingredient of the offence of conspiracy is the
agreement between two or more persons to do an
illegal act. The illegal act may or may not be done in
pursuance of agreement, but the very agreement is
an offence and is punishable. Reference to Sections
120-A and 120-B IPC would make these aspects clear
beyond doubt. Entering into an agreement by two or
more persons to do an illegal act or legal act by illegal
means is the very quintessence of the offence of
conspiracy.

275. Generally, a conspiracy is hatched in secrecy
and it may be difficult to adduce direct evidence of
                        91


the same. The prosecution will often rely on evidence
of acts of various parties to infer that they were done
in reference to their common intention. The
prosecution will also more often rely upon
circumstantial evidence. The conspiracy can be
undoubtedly proved by such evidence direct or
circumstantial. But the court must enquire whether
the two persons are independently pursuing the same
end or they have come together in the pursuit of the
unlawful object. The former does not render them
conspirators, but the latter does. It is, however,
essential that the offence of conspiracy requires some
kind of physical manifestation of agreement. The
express agreement, however, need not be proved. Nor
actual meeting of two persons is necessary. Nor it is
necessary     to   prove    the     actual   words    of
communication. The evidence as to transmission of
thoughts sharing the unlawful design may be
sufficient.   Gerald    Orchard      of  University   of
Canterbury, New Zealand explains the limited nature
of this proposition: [1974 Criminal Law Review 297,
299]

      “Although it is not in doubt that the offence
      requires some physical manifestation of
      agreement, it is important to note the limited
      nature of this proposition. The law does not
      require that the act of agreement take any
      particular form and the fact of agreement may
      be communicated by words or conduct. Thus,
      it has been said that it is unnecessary to prove
      that the parties ‘actually came together and
      agreed in terms’ to pursue the unlawful object;
      there need never have been an express verbal
      agreement, it being sufficient that there was ‘a
      tacit understanding between conspirators as to
      what should be done’.”

276. I share this opinion, but hasten to add that the
relative acts or conduct of the parties must be
conscientious and clear to mark their concurrence as
to what should be done. The concurrence cannot be
inferred by a group of irrelevant facts artfully
arranged so as to give an appearance of coherence.
                         92


The innocuous, innocent or inadvertent events and
incidents should not enter the judicial verdict. We
must thus be strictly on our guard.

277. It is suggested that in view of Section 10 of the
Evidence Act, the relevancy of evidence in proof of
conspiracy in India is wider in scope than that in
English law. Section 10 of the Evidence Act
introduced the doctrine of agency and if the
conditions laid down therein are satisfied, the acts
done by one are admissible against the co-
conspirators. Section 10 reads:

       “10. Where there is reasonable ground to
       believe that two or more persons have
       conspired together to commit an offence or an
       actionable wrong, anything said, done or
       written by any one of such persons in reference
       to their common intention, after the time when
       such intention was first entertained by any one
       of them, is a relevant fact as against each of the
       persons believed to be so conspiring, as well for
       the purpose of proving the existence of the
       conspiracy as for the purpose of showing that
       any such person was a party to it.”

280. The decision of the Privy Council in Mirza Akbar
case [AIR 1940 PC 176, 180] has been referred to
with approval in Sardul Singh Caveeshar v. State of
Bombay [(1958)      SCR       161,     193]     where
Jagannadhadas, J., said: (SCR p. 193)

       “The limits of the admissibility of evidence in
       conspiracy cases under Section 10 of the
       Evidence Act have been authoritatively laid
       down     by    the    Privy   Council    in Mirza
       Akbar v. King Emperor [AIR 1940 PC 176,
       180] . In that case, Their Lordships of the Privy
       Council held that Section 10 of the Evidence
       Act must be construed in accordance with the
       principle that the thing done, written or
                                93


              spoken, was something done in carrying out
              the conspiracy and was receivable as a step in
              the proof of the conspiracy. They notice that
              evidence receivable under Section 10 of the
              Evidence Act of ‘anything said, done, or
              written, by any one of such persons’ (i.e.,
              conspirators) must be ‘in reference to their
              common intention’. But Their Lordships held
              that in the context (notwithstanding the
              amplitude of the above phrase) the words
              therein are not capable of being widely
              construed having regard to the well known
              principle above enunciated.”
                                         (Emphasis supplied)


36. Furthermore, in State through Superintendent of Police,

   CBI/SIT v. Nalini & Ors. (1999) 5 SCC 253 (3-Judge

   bench), this Court culled out principles governing the law of

   conspiracy, though exhaustive in nature, and held:


         “581. It is true that provision as contained in Section
         10 is a departure from the rule of hearsay evidence.
         There can be two objections to the admissibility of
         evidence under Section 10 and they are (1) the
         conspirator whose evidence is sought to be admitted
         against the co-conspirator is not confronted or cross-
         examined in court by the co-conspirator and (2)
         prosecution merely proves the existence of
         reasonable ground to believe that two or more
         persons have conspired to commit an offence and
         that brings into operation the existence of agency
         relationship to implicate co-conspirator. But then
         precisely under Section 10 of the Evidence Act,
         statement of a conspirator is admissible against a co-
         conspirator on the premise that this relationship
         exists. Prosecution, no doubt, has to produce
         independent evidence as to the existence of the
         conspiracy for Section 10 to operate but it need not
                       94


prove the same beyond a reasonable doubt. Criminal
conspiracy is a partnership in agreement and there
is in each conspiracy a joint or mutual agency for the
execution of a common object which is an offence or
an actionable wrong. When two or more persons
enter into a conspiracy any act done by any one of
them pursuant to the agreement is, in contemplation
of law, the act of each of them and they are jointly
responsible therefor. This means that everything
said, written or done by any of the conspirators in
execution of or in reference to their common
intention is deemed to have been said, done or
written by each of them. A conspirator is not,
however, responsible for acts done by a conspirator
after the termination of the conspiracy as aforesaid.
The court is, however, to guard itself against readily
accepting the statement of a conspirator against a
co-conspirator. Section 10 is a special provision in
order to deal with dangerous criminal combinations.
Normal rule of evidence that prevents the statement
of one co-accused being used against another under
Section 30 of the Evidence Act does not apply in the
trial of conspiracy in view of Section 10 of that Act.
When we say that court has to guard itself against
readily accepting the statement of a conspirator
against a co-conspirator what we mean is that court
looks for some corroboration to be on the safe side. It
is not a rule of law but a rule of prudence bordering
on law. All said and done, ultimately it is the
appreciation of evidence on which the court has to
embark.

582. In Bhagwandas          Keshwani v. State       of
Rajasthan [(1974) 4 SCC 611, 613 : 1974 SCC (Cri)
647] (SCC at p. 613), this Court said that in cases of
conspiracy better evidence than acts and statements
of co-conspirators in pursuance of the conspiracy is
hardly ever available.

583. Some of the broad principles governing the law
of conspiracy may be summarized though, as the
name implies, a summary cannot be exhaustive of
the principles.
                        95
1. Under Section 120-A IPC offence of criminal
conspiracy is committed when two or more persons
agree to do or cause to be done an illegal act or legal
act by illegal means. When it is a legal act by illegal
means overt act is necessary. Offence of criminal
conspiracy is an exception to the general law where
intent alone does not constitute crime. It is intention
to commit crime and joining hands with persons
having the same intention. Not only the intention
but there has to be agreement to carry out the object
of the intention, which is an offence. The question for
consideration in a case is did all the accused have
the intention and did they agree that the crime be
committed. It would not be enough for the offence of
conspiracy when some of the accused merely
entertained a wish, howsoever horrendous it may be,
that offence be committed.

2. Acts subsequent to the achieving of the object of
conspiracy may tend to prove that a particular
accused was party to the conspiracy. Once the object
of conspiracy has been achieved, any subsequent
act, which may be unlawful, would not make the
accused a part of the conspiracy like giving shelter to
an absconder.

3. Conspiracy is hatched in private or in secrecy. It is
rarely possible to establish a conspiracy by direct
evidence. Usually, both the existence of the
conspiracy and its objects have to be inferred from
the circumstances and the conduct of the accused.

4. Conspirators may for example, be enrolled in a
chain – A enrolling B, B enrolling C, and so on; and
all will be members of a single conspiracy if they so
intend and agree, even though each member knows
only the person who enrolled him and the person
whom he enrols. There may be a kind of umbrella-
spoke enrolment, where a single person at the centre
does the enrolling and all the other members are
unknown to each other, though they know that there
are to be other members. These are theories and in
practice it may be difficult to tell which conspiracy in
                        96


a particular case falls into which category. It may
however, even overlap. But then there has to be
present mutual interest. Persons may be members of
single conspiracy even though each is ignorant of the
identity of many others who may have diverse roles
to play. It is not a part of the crime of conspiracy that
all the conspirators need to agree to play the same or
an active role.

5. When two or more persons agree to commit a
crime of conspiracy, then regardless of making or
considering any plans for its commission, and
despite the fact that no step is taken by any such
person to carry out their common purpose, a crime
is committed by each and every one who joins in the
agreement. There has thus to be two conspirators
and there may be more than that. To prove the
charge of conspiracy it is not necessary that intended
crime was committed or not. If committed it may
further help prosecution to prove the charge of
conspiracy.

6. It is not necessary that all conspirators should
agree to the common purpose at the same time. They
may join with other conspirators at any time before
the consummation of the intended objective, and all
are equally responsible. What part each conspirator
is to play may not be known to everyone or the fact
as to when a conspirator joined the conspiracy and
when he left.

7. A charge of conspiracy may prejudice the accused
because it forces them into a joint trial and the court
may consider the entire mass of evidence against
every accused. Prosecution has to produce evidence
not only to show that each of the accused has
knowledge of the object of conspiracy but also of the
agreement. In the charge of conspiracy the court has
to guard itself against the danger of unfairness to the
accused. Introduction of evidence against some may
result in the conviction of all, which is to be avoided.
By means of evidence in conspiracy, which is
otherwise inadmissible in the trial of any other
                       97


substantive offence prosecution tries to implicate the
accused not only in the conspiracy itself but also in
the substantive crime of the alleged conspirators.
There is always difficulty in tracing the precise
contribution of each member of the conspiracy but
then there has to be cogent and convincing evidence
against each one of the accused charged with the
offence of conspiracy. As observed by Judge Learned
Hand “this distinction is important today when many
prosecutors seek to sweep within the dragnet of
conspiracy all those who have been associated in any
degree whatever with the main offenders”.

8. As stated above it is the unlawful agreement and
not its accomplishment, which is the gist or essence
of the crime of conspiracy. Offence of criminal
conspiracy is complete even though there is no
agreement as to the means by which the purpose is
to be accomplished. It is the unlawful agreement
which is the gravamen of the crime of conspiracy.
The unlawful agreement which amounts to a
conspiracy need not be formal or express, but may
be inherent in and inferred from the circumstances,
especially declarations, acts and conduct of the
conspirators. The agreement need not be entered
into by all the parties to it at the same time, but may
be reached by successive actions evidencing their
joining of the conspiracy.

9. It has been said that a criminal conspiracy is a
partnership in crime, and that there is in each
conspiracy a joint or mutual agency for the
prosecution of a common plan. Thus, if two or more
persons enter into a conspiracy, any act done by any
of them pursuant to the agreement is, in
contemplation of law, the act of each of them and
they are jointly responsible therefor. This means that
everything said, written or done by any of the
conspirators in execution or furtherance of the
common purpose is deemed to have been said, done
or written by each of them. And this joint
responsibility extends not only to what is done by
any of the conspirators pursuant to the original
agreement but also to collateral acts incidental to
                                  98


          and growing out of the original purpose. A
          conspirator is not responsible, however, for acts done
          by a co-conspirator after termination of the
          conspiracy. The joinder of a conspiracy by a new
          member does not create a new conspiracy nor does it
          change the status of the other conspirators, and the
          mere fact that conspirators individually or in groups
          perform different tasks to a common end does not
          split up a conspiracy into several different
          conspiracies.

          10. A man may join a conspiracy by word or by deed.
          However, criminal responsibility for a conspiracy
          requires more than a merely passive attitude towards
          an existing conspiracy. One who commits an overt
          act with knowledge of the conspiracy is guilty. And
          one who tacitly consents to the object of a conspiracy
          and goes along with other conspirators, actually
          standing by while the others put the conspiracy into
          effect, is guilty though he intends to take no active
          part in the crime.”
                                      (Emphasis supplied)
37. Lastly, In Esher Singh v. State of A.P., (2004) 11 SCC 585,

   (2-Judge Bench), this Court observed:

          “The circumstances in a case, when taken together on
          their face value, should indicate the meeting of minds
          between the conspirators for the intended object of
          committing an illegal act or an act which is not illegal,
          by illegal means. A few bits here and a few bits there
          on which the prosecution relies cannot be held to be
          adequate for connecting the accused with the
          commission of the crime of criminal conspiracy. It has
          to be shown that all means adopted and illegal acts
          done were in furtherance of the object of conspiracy
          hatched. The circumstances relied on for the purposes
          of drawing an inference should be prior in point of
          time than the actual commission of the offence in
          furtherance of the alleged conspiracy.

          39. Privacy and secrecy are more characteristics of a
          conspiracy, than of a loud discussion in an elevated
          place open to public view. Direct evidence in proof of a
                                 99


         conspiracy is seldom available; offence of conspiracy
         can be proved by either direct or circumstantial
         evidence. It is not always possible to give affirmative
         evidence about the date of the formation of the
         criminal conspiracy, about the persons who took part
         in the formation of the conspiracy, about the object,
         which the objectors set before themselves as the
         object of conspiracy, and about the manner in which
         the object of conspiracy is to be carried out, all this is
         necessarily a matter of inference.”

                                            (Emphasis supplied)


38. The prosecution case, linking the other accused persons

   before us to the alleged crime begins at A9. Therefore, at the

   outset, it is imperative for this Court to consider as to

   whether findings of conviction qua A9 are legally sustainable

   or not.




Accused No. 9 - Javed Ahmed Khan: Arrest, Confessional
Statement & Circumstances

39. It is the prosecution case that accused A9 was arrested at

   Ahmedabad on 01.06.1996 which fact is seriously sought to

   be disputed, for, as per the said accused, he was illegally

   detained at Ahmedabad on 24.05.1996. He sets out yet

   another version of being arrested not by the police but by CBI
                              100


   officials, who allegedly apprehended him at Ahmedabad.

   Therefore, the first thing which needs to be examined is as to

   whether A9 was actually arrested on 01.06.1996 or prior

   thereto.

40. Independent of the concurrent findings returned by both the

   courts below, we have, after painstakingly examining the

   record, arrived at the conclusion of arrest being made only on

   the date stated by the police and for this, we straightway

   come to the undisputed portion of the testimonies of PW98

   and PW99.

41. PW99 - Superior Officer had authorised PW98 to search for

   four persons who allegedly had travelled from Nepal to

   Ahmedabad for carrying out bomb blast. Various places were

   searched. Information was obtained about the stay of these

   accused persons from the Anukul Guest House, Ahmedabad.

   Such ongoing search led the police party to the resultant

   arrest of four persons on 01.06.1996 including A9 near

   Rupali Cinema, Ahmedabad. All these facts stand deposed

   both by PW98 and PW99. The factum of such arrest being

   made on 01.06.1996 also stands fortified from the conduct of

   the accused. This we say so for two reasons : (a) at no point
                               101


   in time did he ever protest his illegal detention, if any, w.e.f.

   24.05.1996 especially when he was produced before the

   Magistrate in accordance with the mandatory procedure

   prescribed in law. The plea of illegal arrest taken belatedly,

   perhaps as an afterthought, is only to belie the prosecution

   case. (b) In support of the prosecution case there is yet

   another   clinching    circumstance    and    that   being   his

   confessional statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C.

   recorded by Judicial Magistrate having competent jurisdiction

   namely Bhagwan Das, PW100 wherein also no such fact was

   got recorded. (Ex. PW100/A)

42. Having taken into account the above statements, we find

   ourselves to be in agreement with the reasoning of the Courts

   below, pertaining to the fact of the arrest of A9. On this issue,

   the High Court rightly rejected the contention of A9 being

   arrested much prior to 01.06.1996, on 24.05.1996. The

   Court rightly observed that the contentions of PW98 and

   PW99 are consistent, no question was raised to PW99 about

   this allegation in his cross-examination and that the

   Ahmedabad Court acquitting A9 and A10 in FIR No. 12/1996

   would have no bearing on the present case.
                                 102
43. Hence, the plea of arrest prior to 01.06.1996 needs to be

    rejected at the threshold.

44. We next proceed to examine as to whether judicial confession

    of the said accused was recorded as per the mandate of law

    or not. On this count, testimony of judicial officer PW100 is

    evidently clear. Two days’ time for such purposes was given to

    the accused and that too, after apprising him of the

    consequences of making such statement and only after

    finding him to have voluntarily chosen to depose, was such a

    confessional statement recorded. That apart, it is not the case

    of the said accused that a judicial confession was got

    extracted under threat, extortion, promise or as a result of

    blackmail.   Hence, the statement is totally voluntary in

    nature.

45. A confession is an admission made at any time by a person

    charged with an offence, stating or suggesting the inference

    that he has committed the offence. In law, such confession

    can be made before “any” metropolitan magistrate or judicial

   magistrate, whether or not, he has jurisdiction in the case.
46. A conjoint reading of Section 164 Cr.P.C. and Sections 24 to

    30 of the Indian Evidence Act, makes the confession made by
                                 103


   A9 to be entirely admissible in evidence and by virtue of

   Section 10 of the Evidence Act, in a given case also against a

   co-accused.   The Magistrate was duly empowered to record

   the confession, though, it would not matter whether he had

   the jurisdiction in the case or not.          It was without any

   inducement,   threat   or    promise    and    was   relevant   for

   adjudication of the issues/subject matter of trial. The same

   led to a discovery of fact and the disclosure statements of the

   co-accused also resulted into discovery of fact.                The

   statement was neither retracted nor its credibility and

   veracity ever doubted.      It is voluntary and to our reading

   truthful, reliable and beyond reproach and henc, is an

   efficacious piece of evidence.      Establishing the guilt of the

   accused, we are convinced that the said confession falls

   squarely within the contours laid down by this Court in Ram

   Singh v. Central Bureau of Narcotics 2011 (11) SCC 347

   (2-Judge bench).

47. One of the first pertinent cases on this aspect is Pakala

   Narayana Swami v. Emperor, AIR 1939 PC 47 (4-Judge

   bench), wherein the Privy Council observed:
                                104
         “ …Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Sect. 25 provides that
         no confession made to a police officer shall be proved
         against an accused. Sect. 26 - No confession made by
         any person whilst he is in the custody of a police officer
         shall be proved as against such person. Sect. 27 is a
         proviso that when any fact is discovered in
         consequence of information received from a person
         accused of any offence whilst in the custody of a police
         officer, so much of such information, whether it
         amounts to a confession or not, may be proved. It is
         said that to give s. 162 of the Code the construction
         contended for would be to repeal s. 27 of the Evidence
         Act, for a statement giving rise to a discovery could not
         then be proved. It is obvious that the two sections can
         in some circumstances stand together. Sect. 162 is
         confined to statements made to a police officer in
         course of an investigation. Sect. 25 covers a confession
         made to a police officer before any investigation has
         begun or otherwise not in the course of an
         investigation. Sect. 27 seems to be intended to be a
         proviso to s. 26 which includes any statement made by
         a person whilst in custody of the police, and appears to
         apply to such statements to whomsoever made, e.g., to
         a fellow prisoner, a doctor, or a visitor. Such statements
         are not covered by s. 162. Whether to give to s. 162 the
         plain meaning of the words is to leave the statement
         still inadmissible, even though a discovery of fact is
         made such as is contemplated by s. 27, it does not
         seem necessary to decide.”


48. Further, in Kashmira Singh v. The State of Madhya

   Pradesh, AIR 1952 SC 159 (2-Judge Bench) it was held by

   this Court:

         “ [8] Gurubachan's confession has played an important
         part in implicating the appellant, and the question at
         once arises, how far and in what way the confession of
         an accused [sic co-accused [ As clarified by a later
         Bench in (2004) 7 SCC 779 in paras 21 to 24 at p. 790]
         ] person can be used against a co-accused [sic accused
         [ As clarified by a later Bench in (2004) 7 SCC 779 in
                              105


     paras 21 to 24 at p. 790] ]? It is evident that it is not
     evidence in the ordinary sense of the term because, as
     the Privy Council say in Bhuboni Sahu v. R. [Bhuboni
     Sahu v. R., (1948-49) 76 IA 147 at pp. 155-56 : 1949
     SCC OnLine PC 12] :

           “… It does not indeed come within the definition
           of ‘evidence’ contained in Section 3 of the
           Evidence Act. It is not required to be given on
           oath, nor in the presence of the accused, and it
           cannot be tested by cross-examination.”

Their Lordships also point out that it is :
           “… obviously evidence of a very weak type. … It is
           a much weaker type of evidence than the
           evidence of an approver, which is not subject to
           any of those infirmities.”

They stated in addition that such a confession cannot be
made the foundation of a conviction and can only be used in
“support of other evidence”.     In view of these remarks it
would be pointless to cover the same ground, but we feel it is
necessary to expound this further as misapprehension still
exists. The question is, in what way can it be used in
support of other evidence? Can it be used to fill in missing
gaps? Can it be used to corroborate an accomplice or, as in
the present case, a witness who, though not an accomplice,
is placed in the same category regarding credibility because
the Judge refuses to believe him except insofar as he is
corroborated?

[9] In our opinion, the matter was put succinctly by Sir
Lawrence       Jenkins       in Emperor v. Lalit     Mohan
Chuckerbutty [Emperor v. Lalit Mohan Chuckerbutty, ILR
(1911) 38 Cal 559 at p. 588 : 1911 SCC OnLine Cal 74]
where he said that such a confession can only be used to
“lend assurance to other evidence against a co-accused” or,
to put it in another way, as Reilly, J. did in Periyaswami
Moopan, In re Periyaswami Moopan, 54 Mad 75 at p. 77 :

     “… the provision goes no further than this—where
     there is evidence against the co-accused sufficient, if
                            106


     believed, to support his conviction, then the kind of
     confession described in Section 30 may be thrown into
     the scale as an additional reason for believing that
     evidence.”

[10] Translating these observations into concrete terms they
come to this. The proper way to approach a case of this kind
is, first, to marshal the evidence against the accused
excluding the confession altogether from consideration and
see whether, if it is believed, a conviction could safely be
based on it. If it is capable of belief independently of the
confession, then of course it is not necessary to call the
confession in aid. But cases may arise where the Judge is
not prepared to act on the other evidence as it stands even
though, if believed, it would be sufficient to sustain a
conviction. In such an event, the Judge may call in aid the
confession and use it to lend assurance to the other evidence
and thus fortify himself in believing what without the aid of
the confession he would not be prepared to accept.

[11] Then, as regards its use in the corroboration of
accomplices and approvers. A co-accused who confesses is
naturally an accomplice and the danger of using the
testimony of one accomplice to corroborate another has
repeatedly been pointed out. The danger is in no way
lessened when the “evidence” is not on oath and cannot be
tested by cross-examination. Prudence will dictate the same
rule of caution in the case of a witness who though not an
accomplice is regarded by the Judge as having no greater
probative value. But all these are only rules of prudence. So
far as the law is concerned, a conviction can be based on the
uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice provided the
Judge has the rule of caution, which experience dictates, in
mind and gives reasons why he thinks it would be safe in a
given case to disregard it. Two of us had occasion to examine
this         recently         in Rameshwar v. State         of
Rajasthan [Rameshwar v. State of Rajasthan Cri. A. No. 2 of
1951, dated 20-12-1951 : 1951 SCC 1213] . It follows that
the testimony of an accomplice can in law be used to
corroborate another though it ought not to be so used save
in exceptional circumstances and for reasons disclosed. As
the Privy Council observe in Bhuboni Sahu v. The King 76
Ind. App. 147 at p. 157 :
                               107
         “The tendency to include the innocent with the guilty
         is peculiarly prevalent in India, as Judges have noted
         on innumerable occasions, and it is very difficult for
         the court to guard against the danger. … The only real
         safeguard against the risk of condemning the innocent
         with the guilty lies in insisting on independent
         evidence which in some measure implicates each
         accused.”

                                                      (Emphasis
                                          supplied)

   [See also: Aher Raja Khima v. State of Saurashtra, AIR

   1956 SC 217 (3-Judge Bench); Bishnu Prasad Singh & Anr.

   v. State of Assam, (2007) 11 SCC 467 (2-Judge Bench)].

49. Further, this Court in Jaffar Hussain Dastagir v. State of

   Maharashtra 1969 (2) SCC 872 (3-Judge bench), observed

   as under:

         “The essential ingredient of the section is that the
         information given by the accused must lead to the
         discovery of the fact which is the direct outcome of
         such information. Secondly, only such portion of the
         information given as is distinctly connected with the
         said recovery is admissible against the accused.
         Thirdly, the discovery of the fact must relate to the
         commission of some offence. The embargo on
         statements of the accused before the police will not
         apply if all the above conditions are fulfilled.”


50. Having considered the law on the point of confessional

   statements, we now proceed to examine as to what is that A9
                             108


has stated therein. We deem it appropriate to extract the

same hereunder:

     “We used to do the business of carpet in Kathmandu.
     Javed Senior who is elder than me, Latif and myself
     used to do the business. We used to live at Naya Bazar
     in Kathmandu. In April, 1996 prior to Eid I saw a bag
     and an attache (case) containing the articles, in the
     rooms where we used to live. The bag was containing
     gun powder (Barud). Attache (case) was containing
     wireless set, detonator, time pencil and remote control.
     The Boss of Javed Senior namely Bilal Beg reside in
     Pakistan and I have not seen him. On 29.4.96, on the
     day of Eid, Julfikar alias Ayub came from Pakistan to
     Kathmandu. I and Latif both went to Airport to receive
     him. Bilal told to Latif that boy has put on a black colour
     pant and yellow colour shirt. We brought him from
     Airport. I asked him that does he lives in Pakistan? He
     replied that he is not a citizen of Pakistan and is a
     resident of Kashmir and had gone to Pakistan for
     training. I had showed him the attache (case) and bag
     and had asked him as to what type of articles were kept
     therein? He himself had told me that their names were
     Time pencil, Detonator and Remote control. I had
     already known about the wireless set. On May, 1996
     two more persons also came from Pakistan to our rooms
     where we used to reside in Kathmandu. Latif did not (?)
     go there to bring them. Both of them had asked Latif that
     nobody should visit in their room, therefore, I do not
     know their names. On 8th May, 1996 Itself, Javed
     Senior, Mahmood Killey, Naza and Riyaz Moula came to
     Kathmandu. I and Latif used to work with Javed Senior.
     In the evening of 8th May itself, Javed Senior had asked
     me to accompany (him) to Delhi alongwith the bag
     containing gunpowder (barud) and two detonator.

     Thereafter, on l0th May Javed Senior had sent Naza to
     Delhi who had to make a setting for blast in Delhi. In the
     evening of 11th May, I alongwith Javed Senior, Mohd.
     Killey, Riyaz Maula and Javed of' Soparewala left for
     Delhi from Kathmandu but in the morning of 12" May
     when we reached at the border, I remained there and
     all. the rest moved from there. On 13 May, I left for Delhi
                      109


from the border and reached Delhi in the morning of 14
May. Javed Senior and Naza had asked me to leave the
bag at the house of Naza's friend namely Wazid Kasal.
When I reached at the house of Wazid Kasal, Wazid and
Naza were not present there and women and children
were present there. I asked them to give the bag to Naza
because it contains the cloth of Naza. I stayed in Delhi
on 14th May and on 15th May, I left for Kathmandu and
reached Kathmandu on May. Javed Senior, Mahmood
Killey and Riyaz Maula had already reached
Kathmandu before me. I asked them about their task of
Delhi. They replied that Naza had been given after
making the same and Riyaz Maula was the mechanic
because only he was the trained person. On 19th May,
Mahmood and Riyaz Maula went back to Delhi. When I
asked Javed Senior as to why did they go back? He
replied that the work had been done due to some defect
occurred in it. Earlier on 6.5.96 two persons had come
from Pakistan, their names were Asadullah and Rashid,
which came to know later on and the person namely
Julfikar had come on 29.4.96. After that, the aforesaid
Julfikar, Asadullah, Rashid and myself had left for
Patna in the evening of 20.5.96. On 21st May, I,
Asadullah who got his name written as Nuruddin in the
ticket , Rashid whose name was got written as
Jalaluddin and Julfikar, all left from Patna to Mumbai
and reached Mumbai on 23rd May. On reaching Mumbai,
Asadullah told (us) that now we have to go to
Ahmedabad. In the evening at 8:30 O’clock of that very
day, all the four of us left for Ahmedabad and reached
Ahmedabad on 24.5.96 at 12 O’clock. Thereafter, we
went to the hotel and after bathing there and consuming
the meal at the downstairs (?) in the hotel. Asadullah
and Rashid both left away while saying that they were
going for prayer (Namaz). Julfikar and myself stayed in
the hotel. Fifteen minutes thereafter, CBI officials and
Manager of the hotel came there and said that they
would conduct a search. They conducted the search and
sat over there near us. At about 4-5 O'clock, Asadullah
and Rashid came over there and CBI officials took all of
us to Ahmedabad and interrogated us. I had told that I
had to come upto Patna (only) and I did not know
anything and I did not have any knowledge of other
things. I only brought the bag to Delhi and there Javed
                                 110


         Senior informed about the blast. He himself done the
         work of blast on the basis of planning of Bilal Beg. I do
         not know anything about any other blast. I do not want
         to say anything more.”
                                              (Emphasis supplied)

    (Persons referred to in the above statement are : - A11 - Bilal Beg,
    A7 - Latif, A15 - Javed Senior, A6 - Killey, A5 - Naza, A10 -
    Asadullah and A13 - Riyaz)

51. The accused has given a detailed description of the larger

   conspiracy of causing bomb blasts at Delhi. Independently,

   we find the prosecution to have established the case by

   recording disclosure statement of the concerned accused

   persons and effecting recoveries of incriminating material.

52. It is not necessary that each and every circumstance

   mentioned in the confession regarding the complicity of the

   accused     should     be     separately     and     independently

   corroborated, nor is it essential that the corroboration must

   come from facts and circumstances discovered after the

   confession was made.        It would be sufficient if the general

   trend of the confession is substantiated by some evidence

   which would tally with what is contained         in the confession.

   [Balbir Singh v. State of Punjab AIR 1957 SC 216 (3-Judge

   bench); Subramania Goundan v. The State of Madras
                                111


    (1958) SCR 428 (3-Judge bench); Shankaria v. State of

    Rajasthan (1978) 3 SCC 435 (3-Judge bench)]

53. A9’s confession gives rise to the following circumstances as

    culled out by the Trial Court:

  i.     Stay of A9 at New Delhi on 14.05.1996 (Circumstance No.
         35)
  ii.    Handing over bag containing RDX at the residence of
         PW13 (Circumstance No. 34 – Pertaining to Confession of
         A9)

  iii.   Arrest of A9 (Circumstance No. 40)

  iv.    Travel of A5 from Kathmandu to Delhi (Circumstance No.
         36)


54. With respect to the stay of A9 at Delhi on 14.05.1996, the

    testimony of PW46, is of relevance. The Courts below

    concurrently have held this circumstance to be proved. PW46

    is the owner of Satyam Hotel, Paharganj, who deposed that

    A9 had stayed in his hotel on 14.05.1996 along with one

    Nepalese boy either in room No.104 or 106. In court, PW46

    correctly identified A9. In his cross-examination it is revealed

    that he saw the accused while he was checking out from the

    hotel.   Therefore, this circumstance is proved and the

    findings of the Courts below are upheld.
                                112
55. The next circumstance is the handing over of bag containing

    RDX at the residence of PW13. For this, we consider the

    statements of PW13, PW14, PW91 and PW101. PW13 - Wajid

    and PW14 - Pappi, both are declared as hostile witnesses.

    They deny making any earlier statement to the police; the

    handing over of the bag; and knowing of any of the accused

    persons. Importantly, PW13 as per his deposition is a

    resident of Turkman Gate, Delhi.

56. PW91- Inspector Ram Chander in his deposition states that

    on 02.06.1996, information was received through a TPT

    message (Ex.PW 91/A and 91/B) from ATS Ahmedabad

    disclosing that some terrorists involved in the bomb blast at

    Lajpat Nagar were arrested at Ahmedabad. He was sent to

    Ahmedabad to conduct interrogations. He further states that

    in his interrogation A9 stated that he was given a military

    colour bag containing RDX and detonators by A7 - Latif,

    which he was asked to hand over to A5 - Naza at the

    residence of PW13 at Turkman Gate, Delhi. In court, he

    correctly identifies A9 and A10 on the date of his deposition.

57. PW101 - Inspector Paras Nath (Investigating Officer) not only

    corroborates such version but adds A9 having made a
                              113


   disclosure of having delivered RDX at the residence of PW13 -

   Wazid Kasai at Turkman Gate, Delhi, and on further

   interrogation, revealed that the former knew the latter

   through Mohd. Naushad i.e. A3, resident of P-7, DDA Flats,

   Turkman Gate, Delhi.

58. We agree with the reasoning of the Courts below on this

   circumstance. The High Court upheld the Trial Court finding

   and stated that even though PW13 and PW14 turned hostile

   and did not support the prosecution, the address of PW13,

   residing at Turkman Gate is proved as a fact, which amounts

   to facts discovered subsequently. The Trial Court held that

   had there been no mention of PW13 - Wazid in the

   confessional statement of A9, the residential address of PW13

   could not have come to the knowledge of Delhi Police. Hence,

   the circumstance of handing over of the bag containing RDX

   to the residence of PW13 stood proved.

59. Further, independent of the reasoning of the Courts below,

   the circumstance of handing over of the bag containing RDX

   is verified through the disclosure statements of A3. Such a

   disclosure statement of A3 was recorded on 15.06.1996 as

   Ex.PW31/B verified by PW31 - Inspector Surinder who
                               114


   identifies his signatures thereon and PW101 - Inspector

   Paras Nath. In this disclosure he stated that on 14.05.1996,

   A5, A6, A15 and Mehmood Riaz came to his house at P-7,

   DDA Flats and A5 carried a bag from which he retrieved

   packets containing gunpowder. This led to discovery of fact

   vide recovery memo Ex. PW31/A whereby RDX was recovered

   from the residence of A5.

60. Another circumstance from the confession which finds

   corroboration is the travel of A5 from Kathmandu to Delhi on

   10.05.1996, which stands proven on record as held by both

   the Courts below. In any event, on this issue testimonies of

   PW67, PW23 and PW101 are relevant. PW67- Keshar Singh

   deposes as an employee of Royal Nepal Airlines on 9.7.1996,

   he handed over to the I.O. (PW101) a photocopy of the

   passenger list for the flight dated 10.5.1996 from Kathmandu

   to Delhi. The same bears the name of Hussain M.N. (A5 –

   Mirza Nisar Hussain alias Naza) at Page No. 3 (Ex.PW67-A).

   This fact finds corroboration in the disclosure statement

   (Ex.PW23/B) of A5 that on 10.5.1996 he had come to Delhi

   through AIR Royal Nepal Airlines by the name of Mirza Nisar

   Hussain for making arrangement of gas cylinder and other
                                115


   articles for making bomb and had also spoken with Naushad.

   The recording of this disclosure has been proven by PW23

   and PW101 in their depositions, as has also been rightly held

   by the Trial Court.


61. Therefore, the confessional statement of A9 (Ex.PW100/A)

   finds corroboration through the abovementioned independent

   circumstances. The circumstances which arise and are

   corroborated were not in the knowledge of the police, prior to

   the confessional statement of A9. Thus, the conviction of A9

   is upheld and we find no reason to interfere with the findings

   of the Courts below.

62. On the evidentiary value of this confession against co-

   accused persons, we make reference to the judgment of this

   Court in Hari Charan Kurmi & Jogia Hajam v. State of

   Bihar, 1964 (6) SCR 623 (5-Judge Bench), wherein it was

   observed that :

       “The question about the part which a confession made
       by a co-accused person can play in a criminal trial, has
       to be determined in the light of the provisions of Section
       30 of the Act. Section 30 provides that when more
       persons than one are being tried jointly for the same
       offence, and a confession made by one of such persons
       affecting himself and some other of such persons is
                             116


  proved, the Court may take into consideration such
  confession as against such other person as well as
  against the person who makes such confession. The
  basis on which this provision is found is that if a person
  makes a confession implicating himself, that may suggest
  that the maker of the confession is speaking the truth.
  Normally, if a statement made by an accused person is
  found to be voluntary and it amounts a confession in the
  sense that it implicates the maker, it is not likely that the
  maker would implicate himself untruly, and so Section
  30 provides that such a confession may be taken into
  consideration even against a co-accused who is being
  tried along with the maker of the confession. There is no
  doubt that a confession made voluntarily by an accused
  person can be used against the maker of the confession,
  though as a matter of prudence criminal courts generally
  require some corroboration to the said confession
  particularly if it has been retracted. With that aspect of
  the problem, however, we are not concerned in the
  present appeals. When Section 30 provides that the
  confession of a co-accused may be taken into
  consideration, what exactly is the scope and effect of
  such taking into consideration, is precisely the problem
  which has been raised in the present appeals. It is clear
  that the confession mentioned in Section 30 is not
  evidence under Section 3 of the Act. Section 3 defines
  “evidence” as meaning and including—

     “(1) all statements which the court permits or requires
     to be made before it by witnesses, in relation to
     matters of fact under inquiry; such statements are
     called oral evidence;
     (2) all documents produced for the inspection of the
     court; such documents are called documents are
     called documentary evidence.”

Technically construed, this definition will not apply to a
confession. Part (1) of the definition refers to oral
statements which the court permits or requires to be made
before it; and clearly, a confession made by an accused
person is not such a statement; it is not made or permitted
to be made before the court that tries the criminal case.
Part (2) of the definition refers to documents produced for
the inspection of the court; and a confession cannot be said
                             117


to fall even under this part. Even so, Section 30 provides
that a confession may not be evidence as strictly defined by
Section 3 of the Act, it is an element which may be taken
into consideration by the criminal court and in that sense,
it may be described as evidence in a non-technical way. But
it is significant that like other evidence which is produced
before the court, it is not obligatory on the court to take the
confession into account. When evidence as defined by the
Act is produced before the court, it is the duty of the court
to consider that evidence. What weight should be attached
to such evidence, is a matter in the discretion of the court.
But a court cannot say in respect of such evidence that it
will just not take that evidence into account. Such an
approach can, however, be adopted by the court in dealing
with a confession, because Section 30 merely enables the
court to take the confession into account.

      …The result, therefore, is that in dealing with a case
against an accused person, the court cannot start with the
confession of a co-accused person; it must begin with other
evidence adduced by the prosecution and after it has
formed its opinion with regard to the quality and effect of
the said evidence, then it is permissible to turn to the
confession in order to receive assurance to the conclusion of
guilt which the judicial mind is about to reach on the said
other evidence. That, briefly stated, is the effect of the
provisions contained in Section 30. The same view has been
expressed by this Court in Kashmira Singh v. State of
Madhya Pradesh [(1952) 1 SCC 275 : (1952) SCR 526]
where the decision of the Privy Council in Bhuboni Sahu
case [(1949) 76 IA 147 at p. 155] has been cited with
approval.

In appreciating the full effect of the provisions contained in
Section 30, it may be useful to refer to the position of the
evidence given by an accomplice under Section 133 of the
Act. Section 133 provides that an accomplice shall be a
competent witness against an accused person; and that a
conviction is not illegal merely because it proceeds upon the
uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. Illustration (b)
to Section 114 of the Act brings out the legal position that
an accomplice is unworthy of credit, unless he is
corroborated in material particulars. Reading these two
provisions together, it follows that though an accomplice is
                                 118


    a competent witness, prudence requires that his evidence
    should not be acted upon unless it is materially
    corroborated; and that is the effect of judicial decisions
    dealing with this point. The point of significance is that
    when the court deals with the evidence by an accomplice,
    the court may treat the said evidence as substantive
    evidence and enquire whether it is materially corroborated
    or not. The testimony of the accomplice is evidence under
    Section 3 of the Act and has to be dealt with as such. It is
    no doubt evidence of a tainted character and as such, is
    very weak; but, nevertheless, it is evidence and may be
    acted upon, subject to the requirement which has now
    become virtually a part of the law that it is corroborated in
    material particulars.”


63. Before proceedings with the discussion on the remaining

   accused     persons,   from   the   above   discussion    on     the

   confessional statement of A9 and other material on record,

   here only we record that it is evident from the confessional

   statement of A9 that the blast at hand was not an isolated

   incident. It was in furtherance and part of an international

   conspiracy to cause disruptive activities in India which was

   masterminded by A11, Bilal Ahmed Beg who is a foreign

   national.

64. We now proceed to examine, whether the conviction of A3,

   Mohd. Naushad can be upheld or not?; and If so, then on

Accused No. 3, Mohd. Naushad: Arrest, Recovery & Circumstances
                                119


     Arrest of A3

65. The case of the prosecution is that A3 was arrested along

    with A4 on 14.06.1996 from Platform No. 4, New Delhi

    Railway Station. A3 has sought to disprove the prosecution

    case by stating that he was arrested much prior to

    14.06.1996 i.e. the intervening night of 28/29.05.1996.

66. The   circumstance     surrounding     the    arrest   of   A3

    (circumstance no. 9) has been concurrently held to be proved

    by the Courts below.

67. To examine this circumstance, this Court has to consider the

    statements of PW16, PW39 and PW101. PW16 - Inspector

    Rajender Gautam stated that he joined the investigation on

    14.06.1996 along with PW101 - Inspector Paras Nath,

    Inspector Suresh Chander and SI Surender Varma. He

    further states that PW101 received secret information that A3

    - Mohd. Naushad, involved in the commission of the instant

    crime, along with a Kashmiri youth would be travelling to

    Gorakhpur via Vaishali Express. The police party reached

    New Delhi Railway Station. At 7:30 PM, A3 and A4 came to be

    arrested after being pointed out at Platform No.4 by the secret

    informer. In Court, PW16 was able to correctly identify A3
                              120


   and A4. This view is fully corroborated by PW39 - Inspector

   Hari Ram Malik, and PW101 - Inspector Paras Nath who

   verified the personal search memo of A3 is Ex.PW16/B,

   which bears his signature. The statements of PW16, PW39

   and PW101 are consistent on the cumulative chain of events

   leading to A3’s arrest.

68. The submission on behalf of A3, that no independent witness

   was joined at the time of the arrest and therefore, the arrest

   is not proved, cannot be accepted. We find ourselves to be in

   agreement with the reasoning of the High Court on this

   aspect as observed that Courts cannot completely overlook

   the fact that in matters involving serious offence, members of

   the public are reluctant to associate with police proceedings

   either for fear of persecution or for the sheer harassment of

   having to attend numerous and interminable Court hearings.

   Courts have on several occasions lamented this phenomenon

   and at the same time stated that unavailability of public

   witnesses should not, ipso facto, lead the Court to discard

   prosecution,    or    testimonies   of    police   witnesses.

   Independently, in his cross-examination, PW16 specifically

   states that PW101 - Inspector Paras Nath had asked 7-8
                                 121


   persons to join the investigation, however they had refused to

   do so.

69. The kind of apathy adopted by the general public in not

   coming forward to depose to associate with the prosecution,

   stands highlighted by this Court in Appabhai v. State of

   Gujarat, (1988) Supp SCC 241:


       “Experience reminds us that civilized people are
       generally insensitive when a crime is committed even in
       their presence. They withdraw both from the victim
       and the vigilante. They keep themselves away from the
       court unless it is inevitable. They think that crime like
       civil dispute is between two individuals or parties and
       they should not involve themselves. This kind of apathy
       of the general public is indeed unfortunate, but it is
       there everywhere whether in village life, towns or cities.
       One cannot ignore this handicap with which the
       investigating agency has to discharge its duties. The
       court, therefore, instead of doubting the prosecution
       case for want of independent witness must consider
       the broad spectrum of the prosecution version and
       then search for the nugget of truth with due regard to
       probability if any, suggested by the accused. The court,
       however, must bear in mind that witnesses to a serious
       crime may not react in a normal manner. Nor do they
       react uniformly. The horror-stricken witnesses at a
       dastardly crime or an act of egregious nature may react
       differently. Their course of conduct may not be of
       ordinary type in the normal circumstances. The court,
       therefore, cannot reject their evidence merely because
       they have behaved or reacted in an unusual manner.”

                                           (Emphasis supplied)
                                122
70. Further, in Leela Ram (Dead) through Duli Chand v. State

   of Haryana & Anr. (1999) 9 SCC 525 (2-Judge Bench), also

   this Court observed:

         “11. The Court shall have to bear in mind that
         different witnesses react differently under different
         situations: whereas some become speechless, some
         start wailing while some others run away from the
         scene and yet there are some who may come forward
         with courage, conviction and belief that the wrong
         should be remedied. As a matter of fact it depends
         upon individuals and individuals. There cannot be
         any set pattern or uniform rule of human reaction
         and to discard a piece of evidence on the ground of
         his reaction not falling within a set pattern is
         unproductive and a pedantic exercise.

          12. It is indeed necessary to note that one hardly
         comes across a witness whose evidence does not
         contain some exaggeration or embellishment —
         sometimes there could even be a deliberate attempt
         to offer embellishment and sometimes in their
         overanxiety they may give a slightly exaggerated
         account. The court can sift the chaff from the grain
         and find out the truth from the testimony of the
         witnesses. Total repulsion of the evidence is
         unnecessary. The evidence is to be considered from
         the point of view of trustworthiness. If this element
         is satisfied, it ought to inspire confidence in the mind
         of the court to accept the stated evidence though not
         however in the absence of the same.”

                                           (Emphasis supplied)

71. Even non-examination of an Investigating Officer, where

   testimonies of independent witness inspire confidence, would

   not make the prosecution case to be false. [Birendra Rai &

   Ors. v. State of Bihar (2005) 9 SCC 719 (2-Judge bench)]
                                  123
72. The argument that the chain leading the police to A3 is

   PW13, (who turned hostile), would vitiate the former’s

   involvement, cannot be accepted. We find the reasoning of the

   High Court on this aspect to be appropriate, which is that:


       “The State’s inability to prove the clues or sources or
       even the witness's reluctance to support those factors
       during the trial or the prosecution’s omission to cite any
       witness would not by itself mean that the entire
       circumstance has to be disbelieved. It is a fact that in
       the statement of A-9 made to the Gujarat police as well
       as in his confessional statement, there is a clear
       mention of Wajid (PW-13), a resident of Turkman Gate.
       The prosecution had recorded a statement from Wajid
       during the course of the investigation which mentioned
       A-3. PW-13 did not support this and he turned hostile
       during the trial. That would, in this Court’s opinion,
       itself not give a lie to the entire circumstance leading to
       the possible role of A-9 which may otherwise be
       independently proved as also the circumstances of his
       arrest. In this context, it would be noteworthy to
       mention that Wajid is in fact a resident of Turkman
       Gate, and A-3 also lived in the neighbourhood.
       Therefore, the link in the investigative chain is a matter
       of inference. In this connection, the Supreme Court has
       pertinently stated in Pawan Kumar v. State of
       Haryana, (2001) 3 SCC 628, that:
             “Incidentally, success of the prosecution on the basis
             of circumstantial evidence will however depend on
             the availability of a complete chain of events so as
             not leave any doubt for the conclusion that the act
             must have been done by the accused person. While,
             however, it it is true that there should be no missing
             links, in the chain of events, so far as the prosecution
             is concerned, but it is not that every one of the links
             must appear on the surface of the evidence, since
                                 124


             some of these links may only be inferred from the
             proven facts.””



73. Further, a circumstance can be proved through a truthful

   witness    with   his   testimony   fully   inspiring   confidence.

   Quality and not quantity of the witness is what matters with

   overwhelming      evidence   available   on   record.   [Referance:

   Takhaji Hiraji v. Thakore Kubersing Chamansing & Ors.

   (2001) 6 SCC 145) (3-Judge Bench)]


74. The submission that A3 was actually arrested on the

   intervening night of 28/29.05.1996, needs to be repelled for

   the reason that - (a) the author of the complaint sought to be

   proved through testimony of DW-2 and DW-1 alleging such

   fact, was never examined in Court. In any event, DW-2 only

   verifies receipt of Rs.20 for transmission of hybrid mail

   service, of the letter alleging such fact; (b) Abdul Samad

   witnessed recovery of the RDX from the house of A3, being

   his neighbour. The version of this witness that he had seen

   A3, and his brother being arrested from their house on such

   date is also not inspiring any confidence for, neither he nor

   any one lodged any report and nor has the accused examined
                                 125


    his brother in Court to establish such facts; and (c) the stay

    of the accused at Gorakhpur on 27.05.1996 (discussed

    below), since, at the relevant point of time, Gorakhpur was

    not well connected with Delhi so as to enable any person to

    travel in less than 24 hours. Hence on this circumstance, we

    see no reason to differ with the concurrent findings rendered

    by the courts below.

75. After   his   arrest,   A3   made   a   disclosure   statement

    (Ex.PW31/B), which led to recovery, pointing out and

    discovery of facts as well as incriminating material. The

    prosecution has pressed the following 15 circumstances to

    prove the involvement of A3 in the blast: (i) Stay of A3 at

    Gupta Hotel, Gorakhpur (Circumstance No.13); (ii) Recovery

    from the house of A3 (Circumstance No.10); (iii) Recovery of

    Rs. 1 lakh from A4 (Circumstance No.17);      (iv) Recovery of

    front and rear number plates (Circumstance No.25); (v)

    Recovery of duplicate key from Nizamuddin (Circumstance

    No.26); (vi) Pointing out of shop where duplicate key was

    prepared (Circumstance No.31); (vii) Pointing out of shop

    where fake number plates were prepared (Circumstance

    No.18); (viii) Pointing out of place where Maruti Car was
                                 126


    parked for days before the blast (Circumstance No.22); (ix)

    Pointing out of Dulhan Dupatta shop where the car was

    parked on 19.05.1996 (Circumstance No.23); (x) Pointing out

    residence of A8 from where stepney of stolen Maruti car was

    recovered (Circumstance No.15); (xi) Pointing out of shop from

    where     soldering   iron   and    solder     was   purchased

    (Circumstance No.32); (xii) Pointing out of shop from where

    gas cylinder was purchased (Circumstance No.30); (xiii)

    Pointing out of shop from where drill machine was procured

    (Circumstance No.21); (xiv) Pointing out of shop from where

    wire was purchased (Circumstance No.20); (xv) Pointing out

    shop from where araldite tube was purchased (Circumstance

    No.19), which we shall now discuss elaborately.

76. We deem it appropriate to state at the threshold, the evidence

    of partisan witness need not necessarily be discarded as has

    been held by this Court in Muthu Naicker & Ors. Etc. v.

    State of Tamil Nadu, 1978 (4) SCC 385 (2-Judge Bench).

     I.     Stay of A3 at Gupta Hotel, Gorakhpur

77. In pursuance of the disclosure statement of A3, it is the case

    of the prosecution that A3 had stayed at Gorakhpur on
                                   127


   27.05.1996.     The    Trial    Court   held   this   circumstance

   (Circumstance No.13) to be proved. The Court held that the

   stay at Gupta Hotel was not challenged by A3 and the police

   only came to know about this fact through the disclosure

   statement but for which, such fact would not have been

   proven. Furthermore, A3 has not disputed his name in the

   railway reservation chart. However, the High Court reversed

   this finding on the ground that there were no departure or

   arrival memos prepared by the IOs who visited Gorakhpur

   and pertinently, PW83 who was an alleged eyewitness to A3

   residing in their hotel, was not shown the accused during

   trial to verify his identity.

78. In our view, testimonies of PW40, PW66, PW82 and PW83

   have to be considered for this circumstance.            PW66 and

   PW40 both testify about the visit of A3 to Gorakhpur on

   27.05.1996 through the railway reservation chart dated

   27.05.1996 and his stay which appears through the hotel’s

   visitor book of dates 18.02.1996 to 29.06.1996. PW82, the

   owner of the hotel, also verifies the entries in the name of A3

   in his hotel on 27.05.1996. PW83, manager of the hotel,

   testifies on similar lines and has deposed that A3 stayed at
                               128


   their hotel in Room No.14 on 27.05.1996. Pertinently, even

   this   witness   is   not   cross-examined.   Therefore,   the

   testimonies of these witnesses remain unblemished and

   linkage of him being in Gorakhpur, after the incident,

   undoubtedly stands proven, for which the said accused has

   not furnished any explanation in his questioning under

   Section 313 Cr.P.C.

79. In Joseph s/o Kooveli Poulo v. State of Kerala, (2000) 5

   SCC 197 (3-Judge Bench) it was observed that during the

   time of questioning under Section 313 Cr.P.C., the appellant

   instead of making at least an attempt to explain or clarify the

   incriminating circumstances inculpating him, and connecting

   him with the crime by his adamant attitude of total denial of

   everything when those circumstances were brought to his

   notice by the Court not only lost the opportunity but stood

   self-condemned. Such incriminating links of facts could, if at

   all, have been only explained by the appellant, and by nobody

   else, they being personally and exclusively within his

   knowledge. In fact, Courts have, from the falsity of the

   defence plea and false answers given to Court, when

   questioned, found the missing links to be supplied by such
                                  129


   answers     for   completing     the   chain   of   incriminating

   circumstances necessary to connect the person concerned

   with the crime committed. [See also: State of Maharashtra

   v. Suresh (2000) 1 SCC 471 (2-Judge Bench)]

80. It was observed in Musheer Khan v. State of M.P., (2010) 2

   SCC 748 (2-Judge bench) that it is obligatory on the part of

   the accused while being examined under Section 313 Cr.P.C.,

   to furnish some explanation with respect to the incriminating

   circumstances associated with him, and the court must take

   note of such explanation even in a case of circumstantial

   evidence, to decide whether or not the chain of circumstances

   is complete. [See also Phula Singh v. State of Himachal

   Pradesh, (2014) 4 SCC 9 (2-Judge bench)]

81. On a perusal of the above witness statements, we cannot but

   agree with the finding of the Trial Court and disagree with

   the reasoning adopted by the High Court. We find that the

   fact of A3’s stay at Gorakhpur was discovered by the police in

   pursuance of the disclosure statement and further leading to

   the discovery of fact, the same stands proved through the

   testimonies of prosecution witnesses.

     II.   Recovery from the residence of A3
                               130
82. On the circumstance pertaining to recovery from A3’s

   residence (Circumstance No.10) on 15.06.1996, both the

   Courts below have held this circumstance to be proved. The

   testimonies of PW31, PW41 and PW101 are relevant for this

   recovery. It has been the case of the prosecution that

   pursuant to the disclosure statement of A3 (Ex.PW31/B), he

   took the police party to his residence at P7, DDA Flats,

   Turkman Gate, Delhi leading to the recovery of incriminating

   articles including the RDX; Jayco alarm piece; detonator; iron

   solder; araldite tubes etc. Significantly, the accused does not

   dispute the said place to be in his possession, to which, his

   neighbour also testifies.

83. PW31 prepared a seizure memo Ex.PW31/A of the aforesaid

   mentioned articles which bears his signature and the

   signature of an independent witness, PW92. PW92 who no

   doubt has turned hostile has a different version of his

   signature on the recovery memo, which, we, as already

   observed, have found it to be false. The Trial Court has

   rightly held that this witness did not have to put signatures

   on Ex.PW31/A on the mere asking of the police officers and

   further no allegation was made of forged signatures.
                                131
84. In Tahsildar Singh & Anr. v. State of U.P. AIR 1959 SC

   1012 (5-Judge Bench), this Court held that the procedure

   prescribed for contradicting the witness by his previous

   statement made during investigation, is that, if it is intended

   to contradict him by the writing, his attention must, before

   the writing, can be proved, be called to those parts of it

    which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him.
85. Further, in Hari & Anr. v. The State of U.P., 2021 SCC

   OnLine    SC   1131,    (3-Judge    Bench)    this   Court    while

   reiterating the principles in appreciating the testimony of

   witness who turned hostile observed as under : -

         “It is well settled that the evidence of prosecution
         witnesses cannot be rejected in toto merely because the
         prosecution choose to treat them as hostile and cross
         examined them. The evidence of such witnesses cannot
         be treated as effaced or washed off the record
         altogether but the same can be accepted to the extent
         that their version is found to be dependable on a
         careful scrutiny thereof. It is for the judge of fact to
         consider in each case whether as a result of such cross
         examination and contradiction, the witness stands
         thoroughly discredited or can still be believed in regard
         to a part of his testimony. If the judge finds that in the
         process, the credit of the witness has not been
         completely shaken, he may, after reading and
         considering the evidence of the witness as a whole,
         with due caution and care, accept, in the light of the
         other evidence on the record, that part of testimony
         which he finds to be creditworthy and act upon it.”
                               132
86. In Koli Lakjhmanbhai Chanabhai v. State of Gujarat

   (1999) 8 SCC 624 (2-Judge Bench), this Court held that it is

   settled law that evidence of hostile witness also can be relied

   upon to the extent to which it supports the prosecution

   version. Evidence of such witness cannot be treated as

   washed off the record. It remains admissible in the trial and

   there is no legal bar to base his conviction upon his

   testimony, if corroborated by other reliable evidence. [See

   also Bhagwan Singh v. State of Haryana, (1976) 1 SCC

   389,      (3-Judge   Bench)       and Sat   Paul   v.    Delhi

   Administration, (1976) 1 SCC 727 (2-Judge Bench)]

87. In any event the version of PW31 is corroborated and

   strengthened through the testimony of both PW41 and

   PW101. Their testimonies give us the chain of events in

   which the discovery of articles from the residence of A3 was

   made. From the perusal of the testimonies of prosecution

   witnesses, the prosecution version about this circumstance

   stands proved and the findings of the Court below are

   upheld.
                                133
88. Pertinently, CFSL Report Ex.PW101/G pertains to the

   articles recovered from the residence of A3. In this report the

   following results are arrived at:

  88.1.1 Parcel 1 contains two rectangular slabs of black colour

       putty which is alleged to be explosive substance. ‘RDX’

       based high explosive are detected in the contents of

       Parcel 1.
  88.1.2 Parcel 2 contains one Quartz table clock with two

       black wires soldered with the body of the clock at its

       backside. The clock mechanism contained in Parcel 2 can

       form a component of improvised explosive device.

               Another relevant report is CFSL Report, dated

   29.08.1996, Ex.PW101/C, which is concerning articles

   recovered from the spot of the blast. The report examines 17

   articles and arrives at the conclusion that ‘RDX’ based high

   explosive material has been detected on the contents of all 17

   articles.

         On a conjoint reading of the above, it is thus proved

   that the material recovered from the residence of A3 is

   explosive material in the form of ‘RDX’, no different than the
                               134


    one used in the blast at Lajpat Nagar. The veracity of these

    reports has not been questioned by the accused.

89. It was held in Suresh (supra) that false answer by the

    accused can also be counted as providing a “missing link” for

    completing the chain of the prosecution case. A false answer

    offered by the accused when his attention was drawn to the

    aforesaid circumstance renders that circumstance capable of

    inculpating him.

     III.   Recovery of Money by A4/A7, Whether incriminating
            against A3?

90. It is the prosecution’s case that on the personal search of A7

    at the time of his arrest, a Rs.2 currency note was found

    which was allegedly to be used for making payment of Rs.1

    lakh to A3 & A4. The testimonies of police witnesses, PW17

    and PW101 and independent witness PW35 are relevant.

    This circumstance (circumstance No.17) has been held to be

    proved by the Trial Court. However, it has been reversed by

    the High Court on the reasoning that the conclusion of the

    Trial Court in this regard is based entirely on hearsay and

    the recovery of Rs.1 lakh at the instance of A4 could not be
                               135


    an incriminating circumstance against A3 when A4 & A7

    stands acquitted by the Trial Court.

91. On a perusal of the witness statements as discussed earlier,

    they are consistent on the factum of the recovery of Rs.1

    Lakh from Mangal Chand at the behest of A4. However, this

    Court concurs with the view given by the High Court. No

    direct or circumstantial evidence was brought so as to state

    that the amount of Rs.1 Lakh which came to be recovered,

    was to be paid to A3. In absence of any link to A3 on this

    circumstance, we hold this circumstance to be not proved.

     IV.   Recovery of Number Plates

92. The prosecution case is that in furtherance of the pointing

    out proceedings on 18.06.1996, the police party was taken by

    A3, A5 and A6 to the spots where the front and rear number

    plates of the vehicle were replaced (circumstance No.25).

93. On this circumstance, the testimonies of police witnesses

    although not corroborated by independent witnesses cannot

    be outrightly rejected and to support this, we place reliance

    on Tahir v. State (1996) 3 SCC 338 (2-Judge Bench),

    wherein this Court observed :
                                       136
          “Where the evidence of the police officials, after careful
          scrutiny, inspires confidence and is found to be
          trustworthy and reliable, it can form the basis of
          conviction and the absence of some independent witness
          of the locality to lend corroboration to their evidence,
          does not in any way affect the creditworthiness of the
          prosecution case.”

      [See also Parasram v. State of Haryana (1992) 4 SCC

   662 (2-Judge Bench); Pradeep Narayan Madgaonkar & Ors.

   v. State of Maharashtra (1995) 4 SCC 255, (2-Judge Bench);

   Balbir Singh v. State (1996) 11 SCC 139 (2-Judge Bench);

   Sama Alana Abdulla v. State of Gujarat (1996) 1 SCC 427

   (2-Judge Bench); and Anil alias Andya Sadashiv Nandoskar

   v. State of Maharashtra AIR 1996 S.C 2943 (2-Judge

   Bench)]

94. However, with a word of caution, in Anil alias Andya (supra)

    this Court observed that prudence requires that the evidence

    of the police officials, who are interested in the outcome of

    the    result   of   the   case,     be   carefully   scrutinized   and

    independently appreciated. The police officials do not suffer

    from any disability to give evidence and the mere fact that

    they are police officials does not by itself give rise to any

    doubt about their creditworthiness.
                                  137
95. Significantly, in Kalpnanth Rai v. State (through CBI)

   (1997) 8 SCC 732 (2-Judge Bench), it was held that there

   can be no legal proposition that evidence of police officer,

   unless supported by independent witnesses is unworthy of

   acceptance.   However,    it     further   observed   that   non

   examination of independent witness even presence of such

   witness during police raid would cast on added duty on the

   court to adopt greater care by scrutinizing the evidence of

   police officers. If the evidence of the police officer is found

   acceptable it would be an erroneous proposition that the

   court must reject the prosecution version solely on the

    ground that no independent witness was examined.
96. In State (Govt of NCT of Delhi) v. Sunil & Anr. (2001) 1

   SCC 652 (2-Judge Bench), this Court observed that the

   Court cannot start with the presumption that the police

   records are untrustworthy. As a proposition of law, the

   presumption should be the other way around. That official

   acts of the police have been regularly performed is a wise

   principle of presumption and recognised even by the

   legislature. Hence when a police officer gives evidence in

   court that a certain article was recovered by him on the
                                138


    strength of the statement made by the accused it is open to

    the court to believe the version to be correct if it is not

    otherwise shown to be unreliable. It is for the accused,

    through cross-examination of witnesses or through any other

    materials, to show that the evidence of the police officer is

    either unreliable or at least unsafe to be acted upon in a

    particular case. If the court has any good reason to suspect

    the truthfulness of such records of the police, the Court

    could certainly take into account the fact that no other

    independent person was present at the time of recovery. But

    it is not a legally approvable procedure to presume the police

    action as unreliable to start with, nor to jettison such action

    merely for the reason that police did not collect signatures of

    independent      persons     in    the    documents       made

    contemporaneous with such actions.

97. In view of the aforesaid, in reference to this circumstance, the

    testimonies we examine PW31, PW39 and PW101 are

    material witnesses.

98. PW31 testifies to the recovery of the front number plate from

    near Lal Mehal Khandar and rear number plate from under

    Lodhi flyover near a tree through his pointing out-cum-
                                139


   recovery memos Ex.PW31/D and Ex.PW31/E respectively.

   The same recovery is testified to by PW39 and PW101 as well.

   PW101 verifies the number on the plate to be DL-2CF-5854.

   It is pertinent to note that PW8 had categorically stated that

   the same is the number of his Maruti car.

99. However, the Trial Court and High Court have concurrently

   rejected this circumstance. In doing so, the Trial Court

   observed that: (a) No independent witnesses were joined; (b)

   The recovery took place from a public place, one month after

   the alleged replacing of the original number plates; (c) There

   is nothing on record to show that these number plates were

   lying at a particular place which was only within the special

   knowledge of these accused persons; and (d) These number

   plates Ex.P4 and Ex.P5 were not shown to PW8, the owner of

   the car, at any point during the trial.

100. We are unable to agree with the reasoning of the Courts

   below since: (a) independent witnesses not being present or

   examined does not vitiate the testimonies of the police

   witnesses; (b) the number on the plates so recovered,

   matches with the original number of the car; (c) the pointing

   out memos Ex.PW31/D and Ex.PW31/E have been proved
                                   140


    and   nothing   has    been    brought    about    in   the    cross-

    examination of the above-witnesses so as to cast doubt on

    their testimonies for this circumstance; (d) the front and rear

    number plates are recovered separately from different places

    which further strengthens the prosecution case that this fact

    was not within the knowledge of police party prior to the

    disclosure statement of accused persons and it is only after

    their statements that they could discover the fact of original

    number plates being at different places.

101. Therefore, in view of the above, we hold this circumstance to

    be proved.

    V.    Recovery of Duplicate Key

102. It is the case of the prosecution that on 18.06.1996, A3, A5

    and A6, in pursuance of their disclosure statements, got the

    duplicate keys recovered that were used to operate the Maruti

    Car, which eventually came to be used in the bomb blast.

103. This circumstance has been rejected by both the Courts

    below (circumstance No.26). The Trial Court has stated that

    the key was recovered from an open space after about one

    month    of   the   incident    which    creates   doubt      on   the
                                 141


   prosecution case. Further, PW64 (key maker) did not support

   the prosecution case.

104. We straightaway come to the testimony of PW39,          who

   deposed about a key of car being recovered vide pointing out

   memo Ex.PW31/F and he correctly identified it in Court.

105. In our view, the circumstances surrounding the recovery of

   the number plates (circumstance No.25) and the present

   circumstance (circumstance No.26) stand on a similar footing

   and therefore, considering the testimonies of prosecution

   witnesses, this circumstance is held to be proved. The

   presence of a duplicate key at a particular place, even if that

   place is accessible to all, could only be in the special

   knowledge of only those persons who threw it there, therefore

   the discovery of the duplicate key cannot be repelled merely

   because it is recovered from an open public place. Also, the

   discovery after a month further corroborates the fact that

   only after the accused persons were arrested, did the police

   come to discover this fact.     PW64 is examined for pointing

   out proceedings of where the key was made, which is the next

   circumstance at hand.
                                142


     VI.   Pointing out of shop where duplicate key was prepared

106. It is the case of the prosecution that A3, A5 and A6 led the

    police to the shop from where they got the duplicate key

    made for stealing the Maruti car to use it in the said blast

    (circumstance No.31). We now make reference to the material

    witnesses on this circumstance. PW39 categorically states

    that A3, A5 and A6 pointed out a place where one PW64 -

    Mohd. Rizwan was found preparing keys on the footpath vide

    Ex.PW31/J. PW31 corroborates this pointing out and verifies

    his signature on identification memo Ex.PW31/J. Although

    PW64 could not identify the accused persons but non-

    identification on account of the passage of time is not fatal to

    the prosecution case when he himself has identified his

    signature on the identification memo.

107. The Trial Court held that the testimonies of PW31 and

    PW39,    remain   unchallenged.   PW64,    admits   to   having

    prepared a duplicate key and despite turning hostile, his

    signatures are admitted on the pointing out memo. The

    Court, therefore, concluded that both A3 & A5 led the Police

    team to the shop of PW64 and only in pursuance of their

    disclosure statements, the fact of presence of PW64 on a
                                   143


    footpath was discovered. The High Court reversed the finding

    of the Court below with the reasoning that on circumstance

    No.26, pertaining to recovery of the key, the Trial Court has

    held PW64, to not support the prosecution case, therefore, on

    a similar circumstance, concerning the same witness, a

    contradictory finding cannot be given.

108. We are of the opinion that when the pointing out memos are

    proved, not only through the testimonies of prosecution

    witnesses but also through the signature of PW64 then the

    High Court committed an error in dealing with this

    circumstance at the same level in which it dealt with

    circumstance No.26. That circumstance dealt with the

    recovery of a key, but this circumstance particularly deals

    with the shop where the accused persons got the duplicate

    key   prepared.   We   fail    to    understand   how   these   two

    circumstances are related when a factum of stolen car being

    used in the blast is proved.

109. Irrespective of the findings on circumstance No.26, we find

    this circumstance to be proven through the testimony of

    police witnesses and admission of PW64.
                               144


    VII. Pointing out of shop where fake number plates were
         prepared

110. The prosecution submitsthat on 18.06.1996, the accused

   persons pointed out the shop from which duplicate number

   plates, which were installed onto the stolen Maruti Car, were

   made (circumstance No.18).

111. PW31 deposed that A3, A5 and A6, pointed out a shop from

   where they got prepared two number plates of No.DL-4C-

   1895. The pointing out memo Ex.PW31/R was prepared

   bearing his signature. PW39 and PW101 corroborated his

   testimony.

112. Both Courts below have disbelieved this circumstance. The

   Trial Court held that the owner of the shop was never

   produced for examination and no number plate allegedly

   recovered during the investigation was shown to any witness.

   The High Court upheld the finding of the Trial Court and

   held that no independent witness from the adjoining shop at

   the   time   of   preparation     of   the   identification   memo

   Ex.PW31/R was examined.

113. On this circumstance, we do not find ourselves agreeing

   with the reasoning of the Courts below. The testimonies of
                               145


    the police witnesses, as well as the pointing out memo, does

    not stand vitiated due to absence of independent witnesses.

    Non-examination of the owner does not take away the fact

    that the above-mentioned shop was pointed out by the

    accused persons and the knowledge of such shop was not

    available to the police, prior to such pointing out. We find

    this circumstance proved against accused persons.

 VIII. Pointing out of place where Maruti Car was parked for days

       before the blast

114. It is the case of the prosecution that the accused persons

    led the police party to the house where the accused persons

    pointed out the spot where the car was parked for a few days

    before the blast at Lajpat Nagar (circumstance No.22).

115. PW39 categorically states that A3, A5 and A6 pointed out

    Gali No.21, opposite house No.134, Zakir Nagar, New Delhi,

    vide pointing out memo Ex.PW31/S, on 18.06.1996. The

    same is corroborated by PW31 and PW101.

116. This pointing out has been held to be not proved by both the

    Courts below. The Trial Court held that pointing out memo

    Ex. PW31/S is not an incriminating piece of evidence against

    the accused persons. No independent witness had joined at
                               146


    the time of alleged recovery. There is no mention in the said

    memo as to who had parked the said car at that place and on

    which date. Further, no complaint was received by the police

    that the said Maruti car was parked for a number of days at

    that place.

117. However, on the last point, we do not agree with the

    reasoning as the car stood there merely for one/two days

    which does not create suspicion of the degree that a person

    approaches the police. Independently, the owner had also

    lodged a complaint with the police vide FIR No.286/1996 for

    theft of the vehicle used in the incident. Furthermore, the

    testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are consistent on

    this aspect and nothing material has been brought about in

    the   cross-examination    to    render   their   testimonies

    untrustworthy. The knowledge of the place where the car was

    parked prior to the blast, was in the exclusive knowledge of

    the accused persons and only was brought to the police after

    their pointing out.

 IX.   Pointing Out of Dulhan Dupatta Shop

118. It is the case of the prosecution that on 18.06.1996, A3, A5

    and A6, pointed out the place/shop which is allegedly the
                              147


   shop where these accused persons had parked the car on the

   day of the unsuccessful blast, i.e., 19.05.1996 (circumstance

   No.23). This circumstance is testified by PW31 through the

   pointing out memo Ex.PW31/R and corroborated by the

   testimony of PW39 and PW61.

119. The Trial Court held this circumstance to be proved on the

   basis of the testimonies of PW31 and PW39, which remained

   unchallenged in cross-examination and the pointing out

   memo Ex.PW-31/R, being proven. Further, PW61 despite

   turning hostile, has admitted his signature on the pointing

   out memo of the shop. The High Court reversed this finding

   and held that PW61 could not be relied upon since the

   pointing out memo was not proved and further held that this

   was the case where Test Identification Parade should have

   been done; the shop was already in the public view and being

   conspicuously located, there was nothing to be discovered by

   the police and that no site plan was prepared at the behest of

   the accused persons.

120. In the considered view of this Court, the testimony of the

   witnesses PW31, PW39 and PW61 remain unblemished in

   their examinations. We cannot agree with the reasoning of
                               148


    the High Court on this circumstance. The place where the

    car was parked on the day of the failed blast is a discovery

    which was not in the knowledge of the police, prior to the

    disclosure and pointing out by the accused persons.

121. The fact that the car was parked at a particular place on the

    day of failed attempt is the ‘fact discovered’ pursuant to the

    disclosure statements of the accused persons namely A3, A5

    and A6, thus the finding of the High Court that the shop was

    already in the public view, being conspicuously located,

    hence there was nothing to be discovered by the police is an

    unsustainable reasoning. Further, Lajpat Nagar is a densely

    crowded market, famous for garments, especially ladies’

    clothes and the Dulhan Dupatta is not a famous registered

    trademark or copyright, which anyone and everyone would be

    aware of. Even though the shop is in public view, the

    particular fact that the car in question was parked there for

    the purpose of causing a blast and had there been no defect

    in the battery that place would have exploded that day, is the

    fact discovered pursuant to the statements of the accused

    persons. The testimony of PW61 cannot be overlooked when

    he identifies the accused persons although with different
                                149


    degrees of certainty. The High Court totally lost sight of such

    facts.

122. On the aspect on no test identification being conducted, as

    observed by the High Court, it is our view that it is neither

    application in law nor a right of the accused to claim a Test

    Identification Parade. Mere absence of the same would not,

    ipso facto, render the prosecution case to be false or

    unsustainable in law. [Simon & Ors. v. State of Karnataka

    (2004) 2 SCC 694 (2-Judge Bench)]dana ya

123. Even if the test identification parade is not held and

    witnesses identify the accused for the first time before Court,

    evidence    regarding   identification   does   not    become

    inadmissible and cannot be discarded on the ground of not

    being proceeded by test identification parade, when Court

    finds the same trustworthy.       However, such evidence of

    identification of accused before Court should not ordinarily

    form the basis of conviction unless corroborated by any other

    evidence.   [Dana Yadav @ Dahu & Ors. v. State of Bihar

    (2002) 7 SCC 295 (2-Judge Bench)]

124. In view of the above, this circumstance is held to be proved

    against the accused persons.
                                     150


X.     Recovery of Stepney by A3, A5 and A6 from the residence of
       A8

125. The next circumstance that needs to be dealt with is the

     recovery   of   the   stepney         from   the   residence     of   A8

     (circumstance    No.15),   in     pursuance        of   the   disclosure

     statements made on 17.06.1996. For this circumstance, we

     have to consider the statements of PW8, PW17, PW31 and

     PW101.

126. PW17 in his deposition states that accused persons, namely

     A3 A5 and A6, got a car stepney recovered from A8’s

     residence vide recovery memo Ex.PW/8 which bears his

     signature. He further states that the same stepney was

     identified by the owner of the car and the identification

     memo was prepared. PW31 and PW101 corroborate the

     deposition of PW17. PW8 denies identifying the stepney at

     the time of recovery. However, he identifies his signature on

     Ex.PW8/C which is the memo regarding the identification of

     the stepney, prepared at the time of the recovery, as deposed

     by PW101. He further identifies the recovered stepney after

     verifying the number mentioned on the tyre.
                               151
127. The Trial Court findings on this circumstance were that the

    testimonies of PW17, PW31 and PW101 establish that these

    accused persons had led the police team to the residence of

    A8 on the day, prior to which the police were not aware of the

    factum of his residence. The prosecution has however failed

    to establish beyond doubt that Stepney was recovered from

    the house of A8 in the manner described by them.

    Contradictory versions have been given by the witnesses

    regarding the presence of PW8 at the residence of A8, from

    where the stepney of the car is stated to be recovered. This

    finding is affirmed by the High Court.

128. We do not agree with the conclusions arrived at by the

    Courts below, based on complete ignorance of the material on

    record.   In our view, from a perusal of the testimonies of

    PW8, PW17, PW31 and PW101, it is clear that: (a) the police

    party was led by the accused persons to the residence of A8

    for the purpose of the recovery of the stepney on 17.06.1996;

    and (b) despite turning hostile in his deposition, the

    signature of PW8 on the memo regarding identification of the

    stepney (Ex.PW8/C) remains unblemished and he further

    identifies the stepney of his car which has been so recovered.
                              152


   We make reference of the reasoning of the Delhi High Court

   while considering the testimony of PW13, placing reliance

   upon Pawan Kumar (supra) wherein it was held that in a

   case concerning circumstantial evidence it is true that there

   should be no missing links, in the chain of events so far as

   the prosecution is concerned, but it is not that every one of

   the links must appear on the surface of the evidence, since

   some of these links may only be inferred from the proven

   facts.

129. The credit of the witness can be said to be impeached in

   terms of the prescriptions laid down under Section 155 of the

   Evidence Act. In Rammi alias Rameshwar v. State of M.P.

   (1999) 8 SCC 649 (2-Judge Bench), the Court while

   construing the provisions of Section 145 to 162 of the

   Evidence Act has clearly held that minor variation with the

   former statements would not amount to contradictions, thus

   rendering the testimony of the witness to be unworthy of

   credit.   There   is   difference   between   contradictions,

   inconsistencies, exaggerations and embellishments. A degree

   of which would vary from person to person in case to case.
                                  153


   [See also Leela Ram (Dead) through Duli Chand (supra);

   Calicut Engineering Works Ltd. (supra).

130. What      would   construe   material    discrepancies   in   the

   testimony of witnesses stands explained by this Court to be

   discrepancies which are “not normal, and not expected of a

   normal person”. [Reference: State of Rajasthan v. Smt Kalki

   & Anr. (1981) 2 SCC 752 (3-Judge Bench)]

131. We further place reliance on the judgment of this Court in

   Joseph s/o Kooveli Poulo (supra), wherein it was held that

   it is not that every discrepancy or contradiction matters

   much in the matter of assessing the reliability and credibility

   of a witness or the truthfulness of his version. Unless the

   discrepancy     and    contradiction      are   so   material   and

   substantial and that too are in respect of vitally relevant

   aspects of the facts deposed, the witness cannot be

   straightway condemned and their evidence discarded in its

   entirety.

132. Therefore, in view of the above, this circumstance stands

   proved.

 XI.   Pointing out of shop from where soldering iron and solder
       was purchased
                                  154
133. The case of the prosecution is that on 19.06.1996, A3 and

   A5 accompanied the police party and pointed out the shop

   from where soldering iron and solder for the preparation of

   the bomb was made. PW31, PW39 and PW58 are the relevant

   witnesses     to   be     considered     for        this    circumstance

   (circumstance No. 32).

134. The Trial Court had held that the testimony of PW31 and

   PW39 remain unchallenged and the pointing out memo

   Ex.PW 31/K was proved. The High Court reversed the finding

   of the Trial Court with the reasoning that PW58 was not able

   to identify either of the accused persons.

135. PW39 & PW31 deposed that A3 & A5 pointed out the shop.

   On a perusal of the testimony of PW58, this Court finds that

   he categorically stated that two persons had purchased one

   soldering iron and one solder for a sum of Rs.35. He

   identifies   his   signature    on     the     pointing      out   memo

   Ex.PW31/K and also identifies the said articles to have been

   sold by him. However, with regard to the identification of the

   accused, he does not deny the two persons brought by the

   police to be the ones who came to his shop for the purchase.

   Therefore,   in    a    considered   view      of    this   Court,   this
                              155


   circumstance stands proved. We set aside the reasoning of

   the High Court and the findings of the Trial Court are

   affirmed.

 XII. Pointing out of Shop of Unique Agencies, where gas cylinder
      was purchased

136. It is the prosecution case that on 19.06.1996, A3 and A5

   pointed out the shop from where the gas cylinder, used in the

   bomb blast at hand was purchased by the accused persons.

   The circumstance (circumstance No.30) was held to be proved

   by the Trial Court, however, the High Court reversed the

   findings in the appeal.

137. The testimonies of PW31, PW36, PW39 and PW54 have to be

   considered. PW39 stated that A3 and A5 pointed out a shop

   vide pointing out memo (Ex.PW31/M). PW31 and 36 have

   deposed to similar effect. PW36 categorically states that A3 &

   A5 led the police party to Unique Agencies whose owner

   PW54 was sitting at the counter. Pertinently, the police

   witnesses are not cross-examined on the pointing out of this

   shop. PW54 admitted in his testimony that two persons had

   come to his shop in May 1996. In his cross examination, he

   admits his signatures on the pointing out memo Ex.PW31/M.
                               156


    There is no evidence on record to suggest that such an

    independent witness was forced or coerced to sign the

    pointing out memo.

138. The Trial Court held this circumstance to be proved and

    held that the names of A3 and A5 were mentioned in the

    pointing out memo Ex.PW31/M which contains the signature

    of the independent witness, PW54. The testimony of the

    police officers has been consistent on this circumstance. It,

    however, stands established that, both A-3 and A-5 in

    pursuance of their disclosure statements led the police team

    to the shop of PW54, which was not known to the police prior

    to the disclosure statements. The High Court reversed the

    finding of the Trial Court on this circumstance with the

    reasoning that PW54 was not able to identify the accused in

    Court and the prosecution made a pertinent omission in not

    showing the cylinder which was recovered from the residence

    of A3 to the shopkeeper (PW54).

139. It is our view that such omission does not make the pointing

    out memo which has been proven and the testimonies of the

    police   witnesses   wholly      unreliable.   Therefore,   this
                              157


   circumstance is held to be proved against the accused

   persons.

 XIII. Pointing out of shop from where drill machine was procured

140. It is the prosecution case that A3 led the police party on

   18.06.1996 to the shop from where he had taken one drill

   machine to make a hole in the cylinder vide pointing out

   memo Ex.PW31/P (circumstance No.21).

141. This circumstance has been held to be proved by the Trial

   Court holding that mere recovery of drill machine without

   any specific mark of identification from the shop of PW33 is

   not an incriminating circumstance. The Trial Court further

   held that however, A3 led the police party to the shop of

   PW33 and the police were not aware of it prior to that. The

   High Court reversed this finding on the ground that PW33

   denied that A3 had visited the shop and brought the drilling

   machine.

142. In our view, PW101 has deposed that shop owner PW33 was

   identified by A3. A3 further informed the police party that he

   took one drill machine to make holes in the cylinder vide

   Ex.PW31/P. Further the said drill machine was produced by

   PW33 and came to be seized vide seizure memo Ex.PW31/C.
                               158


   PW31 verifies the preparation of the pointing out memo

   Ex.PW31/P. Even though PW33 does not support the

   prosecution case, he admits in his cross-examination his

   signature on Ex.PW31/C. In view of the above, we agree with

   the reasoning of the Trial Court on this circumstance that

   pointing out of this shop, which was not in the knowledge of

   the police, has not come to be disputed through the

   testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. We cannot agree

   with the High Court reasoning on this circumstance. In our

   view, PW33 stating that A3 has not bought a drill machine

   would vitiate the pointing out and seizure memos as well as

   the testimonies of the police officers on this circumstance.

    XIV. Pointing out of shop from where wire was purchased

143. The next circumstance of the prosecution case is that A3

   and A5 led the police party to a shop from where they had

   purchased two meter yellow colour wire (Circumstance No.

   20). This fact was testified by PW101 as corroborated by

   PW31 and pointing out memo Ex.PW31/O. Both the Courts

   below have not accepted the prosecution version on this

   circumstance.
                                    159
144. The Trial Court held that this circumstance has not been

    proved beyond reasonable doubt. No oral or documentary

    evidence has come on record about purchase of two meter

    wire from the shop of PW32. PW32 denied the version of

    prosecution. He states that the police had visited him and

    asked whether a person sitting in the vehicle had visited his

    shop, which he had denied and stated that police obtained

    his thumb impression on a piece of paper but he is not aware

    of its contents.

145. In the considered view of the Court, the non-identification

    by the independent witness does not vitiate the pointing out

    proceedings and memo itself. In his testimony, PW32 does

    admit the police visiting his shop on 13.05.1996 along with

    the accused persons and the knowledge of his shop was not

    available to the police officers, prior to the disclosure

    statements of the accused.

     XV. Pointing      out   shop   from   where   araldite   tube   was

         purchased

146. It is the case of the prosecution that on 18.06.1996, A3 and

    A5 also led the police party to the shop from where araldite

    tube was purchased (circumstance No.19).
                                160
147. Both the Courts below have not accepted the prosecution

   version on this circumstance. The Trial Court held that the

   evidence is highly scanty to prove this circumstance. Araldite

   tubes recovered from the residence of A3 were not shown to

   PW52 to ascertain whether it was the same araldite which

   was purchased from PW52’s shop. The High Court upheld

   the finding of the Trial Court on this circumstance, on the

   reasoning that PW52, who is the owner of this shop, has

   denied the prosecution version.

148. For this circumstance, reference has to be made to the

   testimonies of PW31, PW101 and PW52. PW101 and PW31

   both have deposed that this shop was pointed out by A3 and

   A5 on 18.06.1996 in the presence of PW52 - Mohd. Alam.

149. PW52 states that he does not remember any specific

   instance as many customers used to come to his shop and

   make purchases. In his cross-examination, he denies the

   pointing out proceedings and further having signed the

   disclosure memos, Ex.PW31/Q and Ex.PW31/P and further

   clarifies that his inability to identify the accused is not due to

   lapse of time.
                                  161
150. In view of the above, this circumstance on behalf of the

       prosecution, cannot be held to be proved beyond reasonable

       doubt.

151. Therefore, considering our view on the circumstances above

       mentioned, the following are held to be proved against A3:

  i.      Arrest of A3 on 14.06.1996 (Circumstance no.9)
  ii.     Stay of A3 at Gupta Hotel, Gorakhpur (Circumstance No.
          13)
  iii.    Recovery from the house of A3 (Circumstance No. 10)
  iv.     Recovery of front and rear number plates (Circumstance
          No. 25)
  v.      Recovery of duplicate key from Nizamuddin (Circumstance
          No. 26)
  vi.     Pointing out of shop from where Duplicate Key was
          prepared (Circumstance No. 31)
  vii.    Pointing out of shop where fake number plates were
          prepared (Circumstance No. 18)
  viii. Pointing out of place where Maruti Car was parked for
          days before the blast (Circumstance No. 22)
  ix.     Pointing out of Dulhan Dupatta shop where the car was
          parked on 19.05.1996 (Circumstance No.23)
  x.      Pointing out residence of A8 from where stepney of stolen
          Maruti car was recovered (Circumstance No. 15)
  xi.     Pointing out of shop from where soldering iron and solder
          was purchased (Circumstance No. 32)
                                162


  xii.   Pointing out of shop from where gas cylinder was
         purchased (Circumstance No.30)
  xiii. Pointing out of shop from where wire was purchased
         (Circumstance No.20)
  xiv. Pointing out of shop from where drill machine was
         procured (Circumstance No.21)


152. The argument and case laws on behalf of A3, that the

    disclosure statement of A3 is in the nature of Section 161

    Cr.P.C. and therefore, is not admissible, is not of relevance.

    The circumstances being dealt with by this Court are in the

    nature of pointing out proceedings and recoveries so affected

    by the accused. Further, failure of the prosecution not to

    array PW13 and Mangal Chand as accused, being a glaring

    omission, would not render any impact on the case as against

    the present accused persons.

153. The cumulative effect of these circumstances so established,

    in the considered view of the Court, brings out the endeavour

    and active role of A3 in carrying out the blast at Lajpat Nagar,

    New Delhi. RDX came to be recovered from his residence, for

    which no explanation has been furnished, and various

    articles came to be procured by him with the purpose of

    carrying out the blast at New Delhi to destabilise the nation.
                                 163


   Therefore, the conviction of A3 by the High Court is upheld

   and the question framed by us, is answered in the

   affirmative. However, on the issue of sentence we shall deal

   herein later.

154. We now proceed to examine, whether the acquittal of A5 and

   A6, is correct in the facts and circumstances of the present

   case?

155. Before proceeding to our discussion, we trace the law on

   interference against acquittal by High Courts. In Major

   Puran v. The State of Punjab, AIR 1953 SC 459 (2-Judge

   Bench), this Court observed:

             “Though the High Court has full power to review
       the evidence upon which an order of acquittal is
       founded, yet the presumption of innocence of the
       accused being further reinforced by his acquittal by the
       trial court, the findings of that court can be reversed
       only for very substantial and compelling reasons. In
       exercising the power conferred by the Code and before
       reaching its conclusions upon fact, the High Court
       should, and will, always give proper weight and
       consideration to such matters as (1) the views of the
       trial Judge as to the credibility of the witnesses; (2) the
       presumption of innocence in favour of the accused, a
       presumption certainly not weakened by the fact that he
       has been acquitted at his trial; (3) the right of the
       accused to the benefit of any doubt; and (4) the slowness
       of an appellate court in disturbing a finding of fact
       arrived at by a Judge who had the advantage of seeing
       the witnesses.”
                                   164
156. Mere fact that the co-accused stand acquitted through the

    evidence against all of them would not be a ground to acquit

    all as held in Gurcharan Singh & Anr. v. State of Punjab,

    AIR 1956 SC 460 (3-Judge Bench).

157. Further, the circumstances under which the Court can

    interfere against the judgment of acquittal is also now well-

    settled. It is not enough for the Court to take a different view

    of the evidence; there must also be substantial and

    compelling reasons for holding that the trial court was wrong

    in appreciating the evidence. [Reference: Aher Raja Khima

    (supra)]

158. Pertinently,   this   Court    has   clarified   that   expression

    “substantial and compelling reasons” and “sufficient reasons”

    or “strong reasons” are just to provide certain guidelines and

    there cannot be any rigid or inflexible rule governing the

    decision making power of the appellate court and it cannot be

    construed as a formula which has to be rigidly applied in

    every case. It is not necessary that before reversing a

    judgment of acquittal, the High Court must necessarily
                                 165


   characterise the findings recorded therein as perverse.

   [Reference: M.G. Agarwal (supra)]
159. The interference in an appeal against acquittal by special

   leave under Article 136, this Court has undoubted power to

   interfere with the findings of fact, no distinction being made

   between judgments of acquittal and conviction, though in the

   case of acquittal it will not ordinarily interfere with the

   appreciation of evidence or on findings of fact unless the High

   Court “acts perversely or otherwise improperly”. [Reference:

   Shri Om Prakash (supra) and Chandrappa & Ors. v. State

   of Karnataka (2007) 4 SCC 415 (2-Judge Bench)].


160. Lastly, in Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v. State of

   Gujarat, (1983) 3 SCC 217 (2-Judge Bench), this Court

   observed:

           “5. …..a concurrent finding of fact cannot be reopened
          in a n appeal by special leave unless it is established :
          (1) that the finding is based on no evidence or (2) that
          the finding is perverse, it being such as no reasonable
          person could have arrived at even if the evidence was
          taken at its face value or (3) the finding is based and
          built on inadmissible evidence, which evidence, if
          excluded from the vision, would negate the prosecution
          case or substantially discredit or impair it or (4) some
          vital piece of evidence which would tilt the balance in
          favour of the convict has been overlooked, disregarded,
          or wrongly discarded.”
                               166
161. Undoubtedly presumption of innocence of the accused

    strengthened by their acquittal against the conviction and as

    said ordinarily, this Court under Article 136 is slow to

    interfere but where the approach adopted by the High Court

    has resulted into gross miscarriage of justice and the

    reasoning of the High Court is wholly against the weight of

    the evidence, making the findings impossible of being

    approved, the Court is duty bound to interfere, as is so

    warranted under law.    [Reference: State of U.P. v. Ashok

   Kumar Srivastava, (1992) 2 SCC 86 (2-Judge Bench)]
162. Where the findings of fact returned by the courts below are

    bordering on perversity and result in miscarriage of justice,

    the Supreme Court under Article 136 would intervene to

    prevent such miscarriage of justice.         [Reference: Kalki

   (supra)]
163. Merely because another view is possible, court would not

    interfere. [Reference : Kallu @ Masih & Ors. v. The State of

    Madhya Pradesh, (2006) 10 SCC 313 (2-Judge Bench).

Accused No. 5,     Mirza   Nissar    Ahmed   @   Naza:   Arrest   &
Circumstances:

164. Accused No. 5 - Naza has been acquitted by the High Court.

    Thus, in view of the law discussed above, a detailed analysis
                                167


    is required for all the incriminating circumstances against

    him.   The   prosecution    seeks    to   prove     the   following

    circumstances to bring home the guilt of the accused:

   I.   Arrest of A5 from Mussoorie

165. This circumstance (circumstance No.34) has been held to be

    not proved by the Trial Court and the High Court without

    any discussion, does not interfere with such finding.

166. The   relevant   prosecution     witnesses   for   proving    this

    circumstance are PW23 and PW43.

167. PW23 states that on 17.06.1996 he along with his staff had

    gone to Mussoorie from Delhi and arrested A-5 from Minerva

    Hotel at Mussoorie and conducted his personal search vide

    memo Ex. PW23/A. Consequently, A5 was brought to Delhi

    and when interrogated, he had made his disclosure statement

    vide memo Ex.PW23/B. The Trial Court did not find these

    testimonies sufficient for proving the arrest of A-5 due to lack

    of documentary evidence. The Trial Court held that the

    prosecution witnesses have given different versions regarding

    their departure from Delhi to Mussoorie and also about the

    time when they reached Mussoorie. Thus, it was held that
                                168


    the prosecution failed to establish the date, time and place of

    the apprehension of A5.

168. We cannot agree with the reasoning of the Trial Court on

    this circumstance. It is evident from the testimony of PW23

    that on arriving at Mussoorie, he made entries at PS

    Mussoorie on the intervening night of 16/17.06.1996 at

    about 01.00 AM, which we find to be corroborated by PW43,

    who stated that they departed from New Delhi at noon on

    16.06.1996 and arrived at Mussoorie in the early hours of

    the morning. In our view, PW43 not stating the exact time,

    does not have the effect of making the prosecution case

    unbelievable. These witnesses have remained unblemished in

    their cross examinations and pertinently PW23 categorically

    denied that the said accused was brought from Nepal.

169. Therefore, the question of arrest of A5 from Mussoorie on

    17.06.1996 stands proven.



   II.   Travel of A5 from Kathmandu to Delhi

170. The most relevant circumstance that led the prosecution to

    A5 is circumstance No. 34, that is, the confessional

    statement of A9, which we have earlier discussed and held to
                                       169


        be proved beyond reasonable doubt. A9 in his confessional

        statement (Ex.PW100/A) clearly stated that A5 was sent to

        Delhi on 10.05.1996 to make a setting for the blast in Delhi.

        We have earlier considered and upheld this circumstance.

        Therefore on the basis of this confession and testimony of

        PW67 we find this circumstance incriminating against A5.

171. Now       we     will   proceed   to    examine    the   circumstances

        pertaining     to    discoveries     made      regarding   allegedly

        preparation/making       of    the   bomb.     Following   are   the

        circumstances relevant for this purpose:

(i)      Pointing out shop, where 9V battery used in the blast was
         purchased (Circumstance no. 27).
(ii)     Pointing out shop on 19.06.1996, where soldering of battery
         terminals is done (Circumstance no. 28).
(iii)    Pointing out shop on 19.06.1996, where Jayco wall clock is
         purchased (Circumstance no. 29) and others as discussed
         hereunder:


        Pointing out shop, where 9V battery used in the blast was
        purchased on 21.05.1996 (Circumstance No. 27)

172. It is the case of the prosecution that A5 and A6 led the

        police party to the shop of PW60, Ganesh Electronics, the

        shop from where they purchased 9V battery to be used in the

        bomb blast at Lajpat Nagar. This circumstance has been held
                               170


    to be proved by the Trial Court but came to be reversed by

    the High Court holding that the failure of the primary fact of

    identification by PW60 of the accused persons, undermines

    the prosecution case. Contrarily, the Trial Court placed

    reliance on the pointing out memo Ex.PW31/L, which

    admittedly bears the signature of the accused persons and

    PW60. The Trial Court had thus held this circumstance to be

    established.

173. For this circumstance, we place reliance on the testimony of

    PW31, PW39 and PW60.

174. PW31 testifies that on 19.06.1996, A5 and A6 were taken to

    Ganesh Electronics from where they bought the 9 volt battery

    used in the bomb blast. This is corroborated by PW39 who

    deposed that A5 & A6 pointed out Ganesh Electronics vide

    pointing memo Ex. PW31/L. This statement of the witnesses

    remains unrebutted during their cross examination.

175. Perusal of the testimony of PW60 makes it is clear that he

    does not deny that the accused persons were the ones who

    had not purchased the battery from his shop and volunteers

    to add the suggestion of the prosecution that perhaps they

    were the ones who had purchased the battery. Further, it was
                              171


   not possible for him to remember by face each and every

   customer. We find this reasoning to be acceptable. He further

   admits his signature on the pointing out memo and does not

   deny the fact that A5 might have purchased the battery from

   him. Hence, we find the pointing out memo Ex.PW31/L to be

   proved beyond reasonable doubt. We uphold the reasoning

   given by the Trial Court in this circumstance. A5 & A6 have

   pointed out the shop from where the battery used in the

   bomb blast was purchased and the police did not have

   knowledge of the same, prior to the disclosure and pointing

   out by A5.

 Pointing out shop on 19.06.1996, where soldering of battery
 terminals is done by A5 &A6 (Circumstance No.28)

176. It is the case of the prosecution that A5 and A6 led the

   police party to the shop of PW38, Vijay Electronics, where

   soldering of the terminals of the battery was done. The Trial

   Court held this circumstance to be proved beyond reasonable

   doubt, which finding was reversed by the High Court. The

   High Court held that PW38’s admission that the pointing-out

   memo was prepared somewhere else and that he signed on

   blank papers is not contradicted. He did not provide any date
                               172


    or approximate period which injects vagueness and weakens

    the prosecution case.

177. The relevant witnesses are PW31, PW38 and PW39.

178. PW38 clearly identifies A5 as also deposes that in 1996 two

    persons including A5 came to his shop for fixing the wires by

    soldering and he got it done through his employee. Further,

    he states that about a month later they came with the Police,

    pointed out his shop and memo Ex.PW31/N was prepared.

179. The testimony of PW31 and PW39 records that on

    19.06.1996 both A5 & A6 took them to Vijay Electronic where

    they had got the wires fixed on the battery used in the blast.

    The place and shop and affixing wires on the terminals of 9V

    battery were confirmed. No explanation was offered by the

    accused persons for having the wires fixed on the terminal of

    the 9V battery. Thus, it is our view that the High Court erred

    in reversing the findings as this circumstance was proved

    when the pointing out memo stood proved based on the

    discovery made upon the disclosure statement of A5. A5 was

    unable to give justification as to purchase of battery and

    soldering of wires on the same day when the bomb blast took
                               173


   place. Further the police was not aware of this shop, prior to

   the disclosure and pointing out by the accused persons.

   Pointing out shop on 19.06.1996, where Jayco wall clock is
   purchased (Circumstance No. 29)

180. The prosecution has sought to prove that A5 and A6 pointed

   out a shop namely, Imperial Gramophone Company, Chandni

   Chowk, as the shop from where they had purchased Jayco

   clock for use in the blast at Lajpat Nagar.

181. This circumstance was held to be proved by the Trial Court

   by placing reliance on the documentary evidence of bill

   receipts and the testimonies of PW48 and PW50. The High

   Court reversed this finding and held that neither PW50 nor

   PW48 corroborated A5 & A6’s visit to their shop. Both of

   them were unable to identify the accused persons. Moreover,

   PW48 not only did not identify the accused person but

   instead positively identified another person.

182. We make reference to the testimonies of PW48 and PW50.

183. PW48 in our view, supports the prosecution on the material

   aspect of the sale of the clock and admits his signature on

   Ex.PW48/A, a receipt. PW50, the owner, admits pointing out

   memo Ex.PW31/H to have been signed by him.                His
                               174


    explanation in clearly not identifying A5 and A6 is quite

    plausible as explained by him, such a transaction took place

    several years prior to his deposition. The testimonies of the

    police officers are consistent on this circumstance. PW31

    states that on 19.06.1996, the accused persons pointed out

    Imperial Gramophone Company where Jayco alarm piece was

    bought vide bill which was recovered through recovery memo

    Ex.PW31/G. The pointing out memo Ex.PW31/H bears his

    signature. PW39 fully corroborates this chain of events.

    Therefore, in view of the above, we are unable to agree with

    the reasoning of the High Court. The factum of pointing out

    and purchase of the Jayco stands proved and this fact was

    not known to the police, prior to the pointing out by the

    accused persons. This circumstance is held to be proved

    against the accused persons.

     Pointing out of place where bomb blast took place

184. It is the case of the prosecution that A5 and A6 pointed out

    the place of occurrence i.e. Pushpa Market Lajpat Nagar near

    Fountain   Park   Car   Parking   vide   pointing    out   memo

    Ex.PW31/T, where the accused persons had parked the car

    fitted with the cylinder bomb on 21.05.1996 at 6:15PM.
                                 175
185. Both the Courts below have rejected this circumstance. The

       Trial Court held that this pointing out cannot be held to be

       an incriminating circumstance against A5 and A6 since this

       spot was known to the police from 21.05.1996, the day of the

       incident. The High Court has held this circumstance to be a

       weak and tenuous circumstance.

186. We are in agreement with the Courts below that since the

       police was already aware of this spot, prior to the pointing

       out by accused persons, it cannot be held to be an

       incriminating circumstance against them.

   Common Circumstances with A3, as discussed above.

187. In addition to the circumstances discussed above, the

       circumstances which are already proved against A3 are also

       alleged against A5 and therefore, the same reasoning would

       apply and be proved against A5. Such circumstances are

       listed below:

  i.      Recovery of front and rear number plates (Circumstance
          No. 25)
  ii.     Recovery of duplicate key from Nizamuddin (Circumstance
          No. 26)
  iii.    Pointing out of shop from where Duplicate Key was
          prepared (Circumstance No. 31)
                                 176


  iv.    Pointing out of shop where fake number plates were
         prepared (Circumstance No. 18)
  v.     Pointing out of place where Maruti Car was parked for
         days before the blast (Circumstance No. 22)
  vi.    Pointing out of Dulhan Dupatta shop where the car was
         parked on 19.05.1996 (Circumstance No.23)
  vii.   Recovery of stepney from the house of A8 at the behest of
         A3, A5 and A6 (Circumstance No. 15)
  viii. Pointing out of shop where soldering iron and solder were
         purchased (Circumstance No. 32)
  ix.    Pointing out of shop where Gas Cylinder was purchased
         (Circumstance No. 30)
  x.     Pointing out of shop from where wire was purchased
         (Circumstance No. 20)
188. Therefore, in total 15 circumstances stand proved as against

    A5 - Naza. The cumulative effect of the circumstances held to

    be proved against A5 is that he, being a part of the larger

    conspiracy to destabilise the nation, participated in the

    planning and carrying out of the bomb blast at Lajpat Nagar.

    His role in the conspiracy is also highlighted by the proven

    confession of A9, wherein he categorically stated that A15 -

    Javed Senior, had sent A5 - Naza to Delhi to prepare for the

    same. No explanation is furnished by him as to the

    knowledge of shops from where different incriminating
                                177


    material is purchased; recovery of the stepney of the vehicle

    used in the blast; having knowledge of the failed bomb blast

    attempt, which pertinently the police could not have known,

    if the accused persons did not point out the same.

189. In view of the above, the question framed by us, stands

    answered in the negative and the acquittal of A5 is set aside.

190. We now proceed to examine, whether the acquittal of A6, is

    correct in the facts and circumstances of the present case?


    Accused No. 6, Mohd. Ali Bhatt @ Killey: Arrest, Recovery &
    Circumstances

191. Accused No. 6, Killey has been acquitted by the High Court.

    At first, we examine the independent circumstance against

    A6, i.e., arrest of A6 from Gorakhpur on 16.06.1996. The

    prosecution case is that A6 was arrested from Gorakhpur on

    16.06.1996 at the instance of A3 & A4.

192. The Trial Court in this regard has observed that it makes no

    serious effect if he was not arrested in the manner claimed by

    the prosecution or that the prosecution failed to prove the

    exact time or place from where he was apprehended.

193. The relevant testimony to prove his arrest is that of PW24

    who went to Gorakhpur from where A6 was arrested. He
                                  178


       deposes that A6 made a disclosure statement marked as

       Ex.PW16/I. DD No.28A made by IO at PS Gorakhpur shows

       visit of Delhi Police to Gorakhpur and apprehension of A6

       along with A7 can’t be ruled out. However, the Court further

       held that since nothing incriminating was recovered at the

       time of apprehension of A6, his arrest is not an incriminating

       circumstance against him.     Similarly, the High Court also

       observed that the arrest of A6 is not an incriminating

       circumstance against him and it is at best a neutral

       circumstance.

194. We are in agreement with the reasoning of the Courts below

       to the limited extent that the factum of arrest through the

       testimony of PW24 stand proved.

195. In view of our discussion in terms of A3 and A5, the

       following proved circumstances have been alleged against A6

       on an equal footing and, therefore, the same reasoning would

       apply and be proved against A6:

  i.      Recovery of front and rear number plates (Circumstance
          No. 25)
  ii.     Recovery of duplicate key from Nizamuddin (Circumstance
          No.26);
                                  179


  iii.    Pointing out of shop from where Duplicate Key was
          prepared (Circumstance No.31)
  iv.     Pointing out of shop where fake number plates were
          prepared (Circumstance No.18);
  v.      Pointing out of place where Maruti Car was parked for
          days before the blast (Circumstance No.22)
  vi.     Pointing out of Dulhan Dupatta shop where the car was
          parked on 19.05.1996 (Circumstance No.23)
  vii.    Pointing out of shop ‘Dulhan Dupatta’ where the stolen car
          was parked on 19.05.1996 (Circumstance No.23)
  viii. Recovery of stepney from the house of A8 at the behest of
          A3, A5 and A6 (Circumstance No.15)


    The circumstances proved only against A5 & A6 are
    enumerated below :
    ix.    Pointing out shop, where 9V battery used in the blast
           was purchased (Circumstance No.27).
    x.     Pointing out shop on 19.06.1996, where soldering of
           battery terminals is done (Circumstance No.28).
    xi.    Pointing out shop on 19.06.1996, where Jayco wall clock
           is purchased (Circumstance No.29).


196. Thus, in view of the 11 circumstances mentioned above

    being proved, we are convinced about the active role played

    by A6 is as one of the conspirators. Though not proved by

    direct evidence, his role is quite evident through the various

    circumstances which show that he has been the part of a
                               180


   conspiracy. His role can be seen from the preparation of the

   bomb till its execution. We find his involvement from the

   stage of planning yet the circumstances that stood proved

   showed his greater role in all the events that took place after

   19.05.1996, i.e., the day of the failed attempt of the bomb. We

   cannot ignore that it is his contribution in rectifying the

   defects along with other co-accused persons as is proved

   through the confessional statement of A9 that actually

   culminated in a ghastly occurrence where people lost their

   lives. It is further evident from the confession of A9, that A6

   was moving along him and other accused, namely A15 and

   A13, throughout for the planning and execution of the bomb

   blast.

197. In view of the above, the question framed by us, stands

   answered in the negative and the acquittal of A6 is set aside.


198. We now proceed to the question as to whether A3, A5 and

   A6 are liable to be convicted under Section 411 IPC for

   stealing the Maruti car for use in the blast.


199. The fact that a bomb blast took place in the car is not

   disputed and is believed by both the courts below. On a
                               181


   conjoint reading of the testimonies of PW8 (owner of the

   vehicle) and PW76 (cleaner of the vehicle) have established

   that a Maruti car bearing No.DL-2CF-5854 belonging to PW8

   was stolen on the intervening night of 17/18.05.1996 and its

   report vide FIR No. 286/1996 was lodged by PW8 on

   18.05.1996. The circumstance of A3, A5 and A6 stealing the

   said vehicle has been held to be proved by the Trial Court.


200. The involvement of A3, A5 and A6 comes to be proved

   through the following circumstances: (a) The original number

   plates bearing No.DL 2CF 5854 came to be recovered at the

   instance of the accused persons and the said circumstance

   has been held to be proved (circumstance No.25); (b) The

   stepney of the Maruti car belonging to PW8 came to be

   recovered by the accused persons from the residence of A8

   and has been held to be proved, the same being identified by

   PW8 (circumstance No.15); and (c) The accused persons have

   pointed out the shop where they got the duplicate key

   prepared for stealing the vehicle and duplicate number plates

   for   the   same   which   have   been   held   to   be   proved

   (circumstance Nos.18 and 31).
                                  182
201. Therefore, in view of the above circumstances being proved,

    it is evident that the accused persons stole the car through

    the duplicate key, it was in their possession and was finally

    used in the commission of the crime. The acts of the accused

    persons A3, A5 and A6, as proved by the above-mentioned

    circumstances, warrant conviction under Section 411 IPC, as

    held by the Trial Court.

Conclusion

202. Having    considered   the    circumstances   alleged   by   the

    prosecution against the accused persons, A3, A5, A6 and A9,

    it is clear that the prosecution has proved the guilt of the

    abovementioned accused in the commission of the crime. The

    last question which arises before us is - whether all these

    accused persons were part of a conspiracy as under Section

    120B IPC? We find this question to be answered in the

    affirmative.

203. The blast was planned at the behest of other accused

    persons,   namely,   A15,     who   was   working   under     the

    instructions of A11 to A1, who never faced trial. From an

    evaluation of the evidence on record including the judicial

    confession of A9, it is evident that all these accused persons
                               183


   were known to each other and were participating with the

   common objective to carry out the blast in Delhi in

   furtherance   of   an   international   conspiracy   to   cause

   disruptive activities in India. All the proven circumstances

   taken together form a chain of events that implicates the

   accused persons.

204. A9 specifically names A5 - Naza and A6 - Killey. A5 in

   furtherance of this object arrived in Delhi on 10.05.1996

   from Kathmandu, which stands proved. A9 carrying the RDX

   to Delhi and A6’s arrival has already been proved. A3, A5 and

   A6 proceeded to prepare the bomb in Delhi for which they

   procured various articles including battery, gas cylinder,

   duplicate key, fake number plates etc.; stole a car and made

   two attempts for the blast, out of which the second one came

   to be successful. This preparation has come to the knowledge

   of the police through pointing out proceedings carried out at

   the instance of these accused persons, which has been

   earlier discussed. Pertinently, the material which came to be

   recovered from the residence of A3 in the form of RDX is the

   same explosive material used in the Lajpat Nagar bomb blast,

   as has come through the CFSL Reports, Ex.PW101/C and
                                 184


    Ex.PW101/G. Importantly, the factum of the failed attempt is

    only brought about by the joint pointing out proceedings by

    these accused persons.

205. Therefore, in view of the above, it is evident that A3, A5, A6

    and A9 were part of a criminal conspiracy to cause the blast

    in the capital city, New Delhi.

206. We also note that the accused persons who have not faced

    trial or those against whom the State has not preferred an

    appeal, prima facie, seem to be a part of this conspiracy.

    However, since they are not before us, we refrain from delving

    into evidence against those persons.

  Sentence of A3, A5, A6 and A9

207. This brings us to the issue of sentence, since the Trial Court

    had imposed Death Sentence on A3, A5 and A6 and the High

    Court acquitted A5 and A6, while the death sentence

    awarded to A3 was commuted to life imprisonment. A9 has

    been awarded life imprisonment concurrently by the High

    Court and the Trial Court. On this point, we make reference

    to the judgment of this Court in Mohd. Farooq Abdul Gafur

    v. State of Maharashtra, (2010) 14 SCC 641 (2-Judge

    Bench), wherein it was held that in terms of rule of prudence
                                185


    and from the point of view of principle, a Court may choose

    to give primacy to life imprisonment over death penalty in

    cases which are solely based on circumstantial evidence or

    where the High Court has given a life imprisonment or

    acquittal.

208. Considering the facts at hand and evidence on record, this

  Court has to be conscious of the fact that the bomb blast

  caused at the behest of the accused persons resulted in the

  death of 13 persons and 38 persons suffered injuries. There

  was   further     damage   caused   to   the   livelihood   of   the

  shopkeepers, whose shops were burnt down due to the said

  bomb blast. In view of the recovery from the residence of A3

  and the confessional statement of A9, it is evident that these

  accused persons were part of the plan for future blasts in the

  nation as well.    The incident took place on 21.05.1996, i.e.,

  approximately 27 years ago; the Trial Court awarded the

  sentence of death on 22.04.2010, i.e., more than 13 years ago;

  and the present accused acting at the behest of the principal

  conspirators; are all mitigating circumstances in not awarding

  the sentence of death even though it falls within the category of

  rarest of rare cases.
                                186
209. The law laid down in Swamy Shraddhanand v. State of

 Karnataka (2008) 13 SCC 767 (3-Judge Bench) was affirmed

 by a Constitution Bench of this Court in Union of India v. V.

 Sriharan & Ors; (2016) 7 SCC 1 (5-Judge Bench) wherein it

 was observed that:

     “51. The truth of the matter is that the question of death
     penalty is not free from the subjective element and the
     confirmation of death sentence or its commutation by this
     Court depends a good deal on the personal predilection of
     the Judges constituting the Bench.

     52. The inability of the criminal justice system to deal with
     all major crimes equally effectively and the want of
     uniformity in the sentencing process by the Court lead to a
     marked imbalance in the end results. On the one hand
     there appears a small band of cases in which the murder
     convict is sent to the gallows on confirmation of his death
     penalty by this Court and on the other hand there is a
     much wider area of cases in which the offender committing
     murder of a similar or a far more revolting kind is spared
     his life due to lack of consistency by the Court in giving
     punishments or worse the offender is allowed to slip away
     unpunished on account of the deficiencies in the criminal
     justice system. Thus the overall larger picture gets
     asymmetric and lopsided and presents a poor reflection of
     the system of criminal administration of justice. This
     situation is a matter of concern for this Court and needs to
     be remedied.

     53. These are some of the larger issues that make us feel
     reluctant in confirming the death sentence of the appellant.

     xxx

     93. Further, the formalisation of a special category of
     sentence, though for an extremely few number of cases,
     shall have the great advantage of having the death penalty
                                 187


      on the statute book but to actually use it as little as
      possible, really in the rarest of rare cases.
      94. In the light of the discussions made above we are
      clearly of the view that there is a good and strong basis for
      the Court to substitute a death sentence by life
      imprisonment or by a term in excess of fourteen years and
      further to direct that the convict must not be released from
      the prison for the rest of his life or for the actual term as
      specified in the order, as the case may be.”

    [See also: Sundar v. State through Insp. of Police, 2023

SCC OnLine 310 (3-Judge Bench); B.A. Umesh v. Union of

India & Ors., 2022 SCC Online SC 1528(3-Judge Bench); &

Manoj Pratap Singh v. State of Rajasthan, (2022) 9 SCC 81 (3-

Judge Bench).]

    In view of the conspiracy, as discussed above, and the facts

at hand, including mitigating circumstances as against the

punishment of death penalty, we consider it a fit case to award

life imprisonment without remission, extending to natural life of

A3, A5, A6 and A9.

210. The record reveals it is only on the prodding on the part of

   the judiciary that the trial could be completed after more than

   a decade. The delay, be it for whatever reason, attributable to

   the   judge   incharge   or   the   prosecution,    has   certainly

   compromised national interest. Expeditious trial of such cases

   is the need of the hour, especially when it concerns national
                              188


  security and the common man. Regrettably, enough vigilance

  was not displayed by the investigating as well as the judicial

  authorities. A prominent market in the heart of the capital

  city is attacked and we may point out that it has not been

  dealt with the required degree of promptitude and attention.

  To our great dismay, we are forced to observe that this may be

  due to the involvement of influential persons which is evident

  from the fact that out of several accused persons, only few

  have been put to trial. In our considered view, the matter

  ought to have been handled with urgency and sensitivity at all

  levels.

211. In view of our discussion above, the common judgment

   dated 22.11.2012 rendered by the High Court of Delhi in

   Death Sentence Reference No.2 of 2010 and Criminal Appeal

   Nos.948, 949, 950 and 951 of 2010 is set aside. The appeals

   preferred by accused Mohd. Naushad, Criminal Appeal No.

   1269/2013 and Javed Ahmed Khan, Criminal Appeal Nos.

   1270-1271 of 2013 are dismissed.

212. The appeal preferred by the State (Govt. NCT of Delhi),

  Crl.A....@ SLP (Crl.) Nos.6447-6451 of 2013 are allowed with

  the result that : A3 - Mohd. Naushad stands convicted under
                                189
Sections 302, 307, 411, 436 and 120B IPC as well as Section

   5 of Explosive Substances Act; A5 - Mirza Nissar Hussain @

   Naza and A6 - Mohd. Ali Bhatt @ Killey stand convicted under

   Sections 302, 307, 436, 411 and 120B IPC and A9 - Javed

   Ahmed Khan stands convicted under Sections 302, 307, 436

   and 120B IPC.

213. In view of the severity of the offence resulting in deaths of

    innocent persons and the role played by each accused

    person,   all   these   accused   persons   are   sentenced   to

    imprisonment for life, without remission, extending to

    natural life. Accused, if on bail, are directed to immediately

    surrender before the Court concerned and their bail bonds

    stand cancelled. A5 - Mirza Nissar Hussain @ Naza and A6 -

    Mohd. Ali Bhatt @ Killey are directed to surrender forthwith.

          Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of

     accordingly.

   Siddharth Dave, Senior       Advocate; Ms. Kamini Jaiswal,
