     was rejected for not possessing essential qualifications

                 Equivalence Committee / H.P. Board of School
                 Education by accepting the qualification of such
                 candidate(s) for his job if that is found equivalent
                 to 10+2 and valid for pursuing higher studies.”

    (J)           As a result of the above decision, many
    candidates who, as per the 2014 Rules, were not
    eligible, came within the zone of consideration and as
    such included in the select list, resulting in ouster of
    such candidates who, though lower on merit, were
    otherwise eligible as per the 2014 Rules. Therefore,



Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                    Page 8 of 57
    some of those ousted candidates laid a challenge to
    the merit list before the Tribunal through O.A. No.
    5543 of 2017 which, consequent to abolition of the
    Tribunal, came to be transferred to the High Court and
    was registered as Writ Petition No. 34 of 2019.
    Notably, though O.A. No. 5543 of 2017 was filed after
    declaration of the final select list, only three or four
    selected        candidates          were initially   impleaded as
    opposite parties.
    (K)           While the recruitment / selection exercise
    under the Advertisement dated 13.02.2015 was
    ongoing, a fresh Advertisement No. 32-3/2016, dated
    18.10.2016, was issued by the Commission inviting
    applications for another set of 1156 posts of JOA (IT)
    (Post Code 556) with the same qualifications as
    prescribed in the 2014 Rules.
    (L)           At this stage, it would be relevant to point out
    that, broadly, two sets of cases cropped up from the
    recruitment exercise for Post Code 447, namely,
           (i)    O.A. Nos. 2830; 2989; 2994; 2998; 3009; and
           3026 of 2017, which came to be renumbered as
           Writ Petition Nos. 2253; 2289; 2290; 2388; 2394;
           and 7681 of 2020 before the High Court after
           abolition of the Tribunal. These cases were at the
           instance of candidates whose candidature was
           rejected for not possessing qualifications as
           prescribed by the 2014 Rules.

Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                   Page 9 of 57
           (ii) O.A. No. 5543 of 2017, filed on 13.10.2017,
           which, upon transfer to the High Court, came to
           be registered as Writ Petition No. 34 of 2019 before
           the High Court. This was by those candidates who
           were not placed in the select list. Their claim was
           that the relaxation order dated 21.08.2017
           resulted in inclusion of ineligible candidates and,
           therefore, they were ousted from the merit list. In
           this O.A. No. 5543 of 2017), the relief(s) sought
           were:
                 (i)   That clarification dated 21.08.2017 and
                 Office Order dated 18.09.2017 be quashed
                 and set aside; and
                 (ii)  That Commission be directed to prepare
                 a merit list from amongst those candidates
                 who possess essential and minimum
                 qualification as mentioned in Advertisement
                 No. 30 of 2015, dated 13.02.2015, and make
                 recommendation accordingly.

    (M)           As in between, another Advertisement (i.e.,
    for Post Code 556) was issued, the State Government
    vide letter dated 19.03.2018 directed the Commission
    to apply the clarification issued on 21.08.2017 for Post
    Code 556 as well. The relevant portion of the letter
    dated 19.03.2018 is extracted below:

                 “l am directed to refer to your letters No. HPSSC-
                 C(2)-970/16 dated 01-01-2018 & 16-02-2018 on
                 the subject cited above and to say that since the
                 posts of Junior Office Assistant (IT), Class-III (Non-
                 Gazetted) have been advertised under different
                 post codes i.e., Post Code 447 and 556 but are to
                 be filled up under one set of common Recruitment
                 & Promotion Rules for the post and as such carry




Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                      Page 10 of 57
                 one or similar cadre, it has been decided that the
                 clarification dated 21-08-2017, issued by this
                 department on the directions of Hon’ble Himachal
                 Pradesh Administrative Tribunal in respect of Post
                 Code 447, be also implemented in the on-going
                 process under Post Code 556, being recruitment
                 for the same post with similar provisions of rules.
                 However, the clarification/instructions dated 21-
                 08-2017 are under challenge before the Hon’ble
                 Court, as such, its implementation will be subject
                 to final outcome of Hon’ble Court orders so passed
                 in case of post code 447 in the pending matters.”


    (N)           The above decision of the State Government
    gave rise to another set of litigation (i.e., Writ Petition
    No. 7585 of 2019) filed by candidates desirous of
    selection strictly as per the 2014 Rules. Whereas
    candidates who sought benefit of the relaxation
    directed vide letter dated 19.03.2018 filed another set
    of petitions. This latter bunch of petitions were allowed
    by a Single Judge Bench of the High Court. Against
    which, the Commission preferred an intra-court
    appeal before a Division Bench of the High Court.
    (O)           At this stage, it be clarified that despite
    request to apply the relaxation accorded for Post Code
    447 on Post Code 556 as well, the select list for Post
    Code 556 was prepared strictly in accordance with the
    2014 Rules, because in O.A. No. 2644 of 2018, which
    later came to be registered as Writ Petition No. 7585
    of 2019, the Tribunal, vide order dated 16.08.2018,
    had allowed declaration of results in the following
    terms:
                 “In the facts and circumstances, materials on
                 record and interest of justice, subject to keeping




Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                   Page 11 of 57
                 fifteen posts of Junior Office Assistant vacant for
                 the applicants and final outcome of the original
                 application, respondent no. 3-Commission shall
                 be free to declare the result of the process for
                 recruitment to the post of Junior Office
                 Assistants.”


          The above order was assailed before the High Court
    through Writ Petition No. 1964 of 2018, which was
    disposed of vide order dated 28.08.2018 in the
    following terms:
                 “In this background we clarify that the
                 appointments to the posts of Junior Office
                 Assistant (Code 556) shall be strictly in
                 accordance with the Common Recruitment &
                 Promotion Rules for the posts of Junior Office
                 Assistant (Information Technology), Class-Ill (Non-
                 gazetted) in various Departments of Himachal
                 Pradesh Government, as also Advertisement No.
                 32-3/2016 and not in terms of communication,
                 dated 19th March 2018.”

          A review of the order dated 28.08.2018 was sought,
    which was decided on 05.11.2018 in the following
    terms:
                 “Be that as it may, as the matter is sub judice
                 before the learned Tribunal and the Committee
                 which has submitted its report on 21.08.2017,
                 has been so constituted by the learned Tribunal,
                 its recommendations, can be looked into by the
                 learned Tribunal uninfluenced by any observation
                 made by this Court in the perspective of the
                 Common Recruitment & Promotion Rules, in the
                 backdrop of the controversy involved in the
                 application before it.”

    (P)           In between, another O. A. No. 7397 of 2018
    was filed before the Tribunal praying that persons
    holding qualifications other than the one prescribed
    be not considered for selection. On this application, an



Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                   Page 12 of 57
    order dated 21.12.2018 was passed requiring the
    Commission to make selections against Post Code 556
    strictly as per 2014 Rules.
    (Q)           The order of the Tribunal dated 21.12.2018
    was challenged before the High Court in Writ Petition
    No. 161 of 2019. Therein, on 11.01.2019, an interim
    order was passed in the following terms:
                 “Meanwhile the operation of the impugned order
                 dated 21.12.2018 (Annexure P-7) passed by
                 Himachal Pradesh Administrative Tribunal in
                 O.A. No. 7397 of 2018 shall remain stayed.
                 However, the Staff Selection Commission shall
                 only allow the eligible candidates to participate in
                 the process.”

    (R)           In the light of various interim orders, after
    carrying out the selection process, the Commission
    declared result of Post Code 556 on 23.02.2019
    thereby recommending 596 candidates only. While
    doing so, candidature of several candidates, who were
    found ineligible under the 2014 Rules, was rejected.
    (S)           The      candidates        who   were   rejected      as
    ineligible approached the Tribunal. On 26.02.2019,
    the Tribunal, in O.A. No. 677 of 2019 (later registered
    as Writ Petition No. 20 of 2019), directed status quo
    with regard to appointments pursuant to the declared
    result for Post Code 556.
    (T)           Aggrieved by the order of the Tribunal dated
    26.02.2019, a group of selected candidates filed Writ
    Petition No. 629 of 2019 before the High Court. On
    29.08.2019, Writ Petition Nos. 161 of 2019 and 629 of




Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                    Page 13 of 57
    2019 were finally decided, whereby Writ Petition No.
    161 of 2019, filed by candidates claiming to possess
    qualifications higher than prescribed, was dismissed;
    and Writ Petition No. 629 of 2019 filed against the
    interim order dated 26.02.2019 was allowed.
    (U)           The order dated 29.08.2019 passed in Writ
    Petition Nos. 161 of 2019 and 629 of 2019 was
    subjected to a Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 45 of
    2021, which was dismissed by this Court vide order
    dated 15.11.2021. In these circumstances, selection /
    recruitment            for     Post      Code     556,      under     the
    Advertisement dated 18.10.2016, was carried out
    strictly in accordance with the 2014 Rules. And 531
    posts advertised for Post Code 556 remained unfilled.
    (V)           There was another petition, namely, writ
    Petition No.2246 of 2019, filed by candidates who were
    excluded          from       consideration       though      they   held
    equivalent qualifications for Post Code 556. Here, an
    interim        order       was       passed     directing    that    any
    appointment against Post Code 556 shall be subject to
    the orders passed in that petition.
    (W)           On      06.12.2019,         the    State      Government
    directed the Commission to treat the recruitment
    process for Post Code 556 concluded. It also requested
    the Commission to re-advertise the unfilled posts and
    carry       out      recruitment         as     per   new     Common
    Recruitment & Promotion Rules of the year 2020,




Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                        Page 14 of 57
       which prescribed the essential qualifications as
       follows:
                   “(a) ESSENTIAL QUALIFICATION(S):
                   (i)   Should have          passed 10+2 from a
                   recognized   Board         of   School Education
                   /University.
                                            OR
                   Matriculation from recognized Board of School
                   Education          with       one/two       year's
                   Diploma/Certificate from an Industrial Training
                   Institute (ITI) in Information Technology Enabled
                   Sectors (ITES) as notified by Director General of
                   Employment & Training (Govt. of India) from time
                   to time or three years Diploma in Computer
                   Engineering /Computer Science/ IT from
                   Polytechnic as approved by All India Council for
                   Technical Education (AICTE).”

       (X)         Pursuant thereto, on 21.09.2020, a fresh
       advertisement No. 36-2/2020 was issued by the
       Commission inviting applications for the post of
       Junior Office Assistant-JOA (IT) (Post Code 817).
       (Y)         On issuance of fresh advertisement, in Writ
       Petition No. 2246 of 2019, following interim order was
       passed:
                   “Pursuant to Advertisement No. 36-2/2020 dated
                   21.09.2020, issued by respondent-HPSSC for the
                   post of Junior Office Assistant-JOA (IT), the
                   respondent-Himachal Pradesh Staff Selection
                   Commission, Hamirpur is permitted to proceed
                   with the recruitment process, however, the final
                   result shall not be announced without permission
                   of this Court. Applications stand disposed of.”


Summary of the Litigation before the High Court

4.           A conspectus of the narration above would indicate
that         litigation     emanated          from   three   successive
advertisements             issued        by   the    Selection     Board/




 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                      Page 15 of 57
Commission inviting applications for the post of JOA (IT).
The first advertisement is dated 13.02.2015 for 1421 posts
(i.e., Post Code 447). The second is dated 18.10.2016 for
1156 posts (i.e., Post Code 556); and the third is dated
21.09.2020 for 1869 posts (i.e., Post Code 817).
5.         Under the first advertisement for Post Code 447,
the advertised posts were filled with the aid of the order
dated 21.08.2017, which relaxed the advertised eligibility
conditions. The litigation therein was initiated by two sets
of candidates. One set comprised of those whose
candidature got rejected because they failed to meet the
eligibility criteria prescribed in the advertisement and the
2014 Rules. The other set comprised of those candidates
who were aggrieved by relaxation of the eligibility criteria
as it expanded the zone of consideration and thereby
reduced their chance of selection. They, therefore,
questioned the validity of the order of relaxation dated
21.08.2017 as also the selection made thereunder. The
challenge laid by them was to the effect that once the 2014
Rules prescribed the essential qualifications, and the
advertisement prescribed the same essential qualifications
without reserving any power to relax the same at any later
stage, how could there be a relaxation of these prescribed
essential qualifications. Their prayer, therefore, was that
the select list must comprise of only such candidates who
hold the prescribed minimum eligibility qualifications by
the last date for receipt of the application under the
advertisement. Such a challenge was laid through Writ




 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022        Page 16 of 57
Petition No. 34 of 2019, which was originally filed before
the Tribunal as O.A. No. 5543 of 2017.
6.         In respect of recruitment against the second
advertisement for Post Code 556, challenge was laid by
those who either held qualifications at variance from the
one prescribed, or had certificate(s) / diploma(s) from such
institutes that were not considered recognized. Their
challenge was premised on the relaxation granted earlier
in    connection          with      the       exercise   under     the    first
advertisement for Post Code 447. Their case was that once
relaxation to the eligibility conditions prescribed in the
2014 Rules was allowed qua the first advertisement, the
recruitment to the same post, advertised as Post Code 556,
under the same set of Rules, must be subject to same
relaxation.        These        candidates,        therefore,     challenged
rejection of their candidature and prayed that the merit-
list be re-drawn by treating their candidature as valid.
7.         In respect of the third advertisement dated
21.09.2020, the challenge was confined to 531 posts that
were carried forward as unfilled vacancies notified under
the second advertisement for Post Code 556. In this
category of cases, the claim was that vacant posts of JOA,
advertised as Post Code 556, should not have been left
unfilled as eligible candidates were available had the
benefit of the relaxation been provided. They, therefore,
claimed        that       those          carry    forward       posts,    now
advertised as Post Code 817, be segregated and filled
as     part of the second advertisement by taking into




 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                        Page 17 of 57
consideration those candidates who would be eligible by
virtue of the relaxation.
Findings / Observations of the High Court in the
impugned judgment
8.          The High Court found / held / observed:
     (i)            The essential qualifications prescribed in the
     2014 Rules as “one year diploma in Computer Science
     / Computer Application / Information Technology
     from       a    recognized          University   /   Institution”    is
     ambiguous and creates confusion, firstly, because
     expression “recognized University / Institution” is not
     defined, and, secondly, diploma qualification may be
     held under different nomenclatures. The High Court
     held that though there could be no dispute regarding
     a recognized University but as regards the authority
     competent to recognize an institution to award a
     diploma, there is no clarity. Therefore, the decision to
     relax the essential qualifications dated 21.08.2017
     was within the powers of the State Government
     conferred by Rule 18 of the 2014 Rules. Hence, it was
     rightly applied on the recruitment exercise carried out
     under the first advertisement dated 13.02.2015.
     (ii)           Computer Science / Information Technology
     are subjects of wide amplitude and are admissible to
     differing nomenclatures and cannot be restricted to
     the one found in the 2014 Rules / Advertisement.
     Thus, in absence of any clarity as to the kind of
     curricula required to obtain the required diploma /
     certificate to become eligible, the decision of the State



 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                     Page 18 of 57
    Government dated 21.08.2017 cannot be faulted,
    particularly, when there is no clarity as to the
    authority competent to accord recognition. While
    holding so, the High Court took note of the essential
    qualifications prescribed in the 2020 Rules for the
    post of JOA (IT), which were more specific as regards
    the authority competent to recognize.
    (iii)         Advent of computerization and wide use of
    information technology has caused a sense of urgency
    for appointment(s) on the posts advertised across
    various departments of the State Government. This is
    reflected by successive advertisements for the posts.
    In that scenario, to meet the exigency, if an exercise to
    constitute an equivalence committee was undertaken
    pursuant to a judicial order of the Tribunal dated
    30.06.2017, which was not assailed by any of the writ
    petitioners, departure, if any, from the 2014 Rules
    cannot be faulted. Otherwise also, where rules are
    ambiguous, and it may take time to amend the rules,
    relaxation and clarifications are permissible as part of
    administrative exigency.
    (iv)          There is nothing on record to infer that action
    of the State Government / HPSSC was actuated by
    extraneous consideration(s) or lack of bona fide(s).
    (v)           The petitioners could not substantiate that
    anyone or more of the selected persons obtained the
    requisite qualifications after the cut-off date.

Impugned Decision of the High Court

9.         In light of the findings / observations noticed
above, the High Court dismissed Writ Petition No. 34 of
2019 which questioned the relaxation order; and upheld
the process of selection and appointment against Post
Code 447. Consequent to the dismissal of Writ Petition No.
34 of 2019, other writ petitions, namely, numbered 2253,
2289, 2290, 2388, 2394 and 7681 of 2020, which were
filed for consideration of candidates who benefited from
the relaxation order, were dismissed as infructuous.
10.        Writ petitions seeking relaxation in the eligibility
conditions for the second advertisement (i.e., for Post Code
556) in terms provided for Post Code 447, were disposed
of by directing that same relaxation be accorded for Post
Code 556 as accorded for Post Code 447. In consequence,
the High Court, in paragraphs 33 and 34 of the impugned
judgment, directed:
                  “33. Thus, the HPSSC is directed to re-cast the
                  merit list for JOA 556 by including all categories
                  of candidate as was done for JOA 447 on the
                  basis of decision of Government dated
                  21.8.2017/ 18.9.2017 and further made
                  applicable to JOA 556 vide communication
                  19.3.2018 except the candidates with higher
                  qualification, who have already been held
                  ineligible vide judgment dated 29.8.2019 of a
                  Division Bench of this Court in CWP 161/2019.
                  These selections for JOA 556 shall be made by
                  taking into account the entire number of vacancies
                  advertised for JOA 556 and the decision of the
                  Government/HPSSC to close the selection
                  procedure for JOA 556 is set aside and quashed.

 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                  Page 20 of 57
                  34. Since the Common R&P Rules stand amended
                  by 2020 Rules and the cause of persistent
                  confusion for the time being appears to have been
                  removed, as a necessary consequence selection
                  for JOA 817 shall take place in accordance with
                  2020 Rules, however, the selection process shall
                  not include the selection for posts which were left
                  over from advertised posts of JOA 556 as the said
                  posts have already been directed to be filled
                  through selection process of JOA 556.”

11.        The resultant effect of the above directions would
be that for recruitment against Post Code 556, candidates
who, but for the relaxation dated 21.08.2017, were
ineligible under the 2014 Rules, were to be treated eligible
and the merit list redrawn accordingly. Not only that, 531
posts of Post Code 556, which remained unfilled, and,
therefore,        carried        forward,     and   re-advertised       on
21.09.2020, were to be segregated and filled in terms of
the direction above. In consequence, the number of posts
advertised under the advertisement dated 21.09.2020
were to get reduced to that extent. However, as per the
decision of the High Court, the candidates who professed
holding qualifications higher than the one prescribed were
not to get any benefit as that issue already stood
concluded vide judgment and order of the High Court
dated 29.08.2019, passed in Writ Petition No.161 of 2019,
against which SLP (C) No.45 of 2021 was dismissed by this
Court.

Appeals Before This Court
12.        (A) Arising out of SLP (C) No. 730 of 2022:

 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                   Page 21 of 57
     This appeal questions the direction given in paragraph
33 of the impugned judgment. The appellants herein claim
that they hold the requisite eligibility qualifications
prescribed by the 2014 Rules as well as the advertisement;
they participated in the recruitment exercise for Post Code
556 and were placed in the merit-list; if candidates who
were otherwise not eligible, but for the relaxation, are
permitted to be considered, as directed in paragraph 33,
the merit-list might have to be re-drawn and they may be
ousted and replaced by those who, otherwise, were
ineligible. These appellants have, therefore, prayed that
the direction given by the High Court in paragraph 33 of
the impugned judgment be quashed and the earlier merit-
list be not disturbed.
       In     this      appeal,         intervention   /   impleadment
application(s) (i.e., I.A. Nos. 30862 of 2022; 26627 of 2022;
and 73507 of 2022) have been filed by such candidates
who were to benefit by the direction given in paragraph 33
of the impugned judgment.
       Another I.A. No 14524 of 2022 has been filed for
impleading parties who had put in appearance through
various intervention applications. Yet another I.A. No.
5062 of 2022 has been filed to bring on record:
     (a)           a copy of letter issued by the Director of
     Higher Education, Govt. of Himachal Pradesh;
     (b)           copy of the order of the High Court dated
     29.08.2019 passed in Writ Petition Nos. 629 of 2019
     and 161 of 2019; and




 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                   Page 22 of 57
      (c)          copy of the order dated 15.11.2021 passed by
      this Court in SLP (C) No. 45 of 2021 whereby Special
      Leave Petition preferred against the order of the High
      Court dated 29.08.2019 was dismissed.

(B)    Arising out of SLP (C) No. 729 of 2022:
       This appeal is also at the instance of those
candidates who were considered and selected under the
second advertisement for Post Code 556.              They are,
therefore, similarly aggrieved as the appellants of appeal
arising out of SLP (C) No. 730 of 2022.
       In this appeal, too, an Impleadment Application No.
15047 of 2022 has been filed to bring on record parties
who had put in appearance through various intervention
applications.

(C)    Arising out of SLP (C) No. 4321 of 2022:
       This appeal is by the writ petitioners of Writ Petition
No. 34 of 2019 before the High Court. They are aggrieved
by dismissal of their writ petition which sought:
      (a) quashing of the relaxation order dated 21.08.2017;
      and
      (b) a direction upon HPSSC to prepare the merit-list
      by including only those candidates who possess
      essential minimum qualifications as specified in
      advertisement No. 30 of 2015 dated 13.02.2015.
      Appellants herein are those candidates who failed to
find their name in the select list prepared after the




 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022           Page 23 of 57
recruitment exercise under the first advertisement for Post
Code 447.
       In this appeal, I.A. No. 56457 of 2022 has been filed
for bringing on record copy of the order dated 29 th March
2022 passed by the High Court in Writ Petition No. 113 of
2019 whereby the said writ petition was dismissed by a
Single Bench of the High Court.
       Another I.A. No. 100627 of 2022 has been filed by a
bunch of candidates who claim to have possessed
qualifications higher than the one specified in the
Advertisement for Post Code 447. According to them, they
hold Degree instead of Diploma and Degree being higher
than Diploma, they were eligible.
       Yet another I.A. No. 188852 of 2022 has been filed to
bring on record:
      (i) An RTI query report dated 02.07.2022. This is to
      the effect that the relaxation order dated 21.08.2017
      was not published in any Newspaper, E-Gazette or
      Official website; and
      (ii) A chart containing reasons as to why some of the
      selected candidates were not qualified/ eligible for
      consideration against Post Code 447. Note: It is not
      clear whether this chart was ever placed before the
      High Court.

(D)    Arising out of SLP (C) No. 9977 of 2022:
       This appeal is by those candidates who participated
under the second advertisement and got selected for




 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022       Page 24 of 57
appointment against Post Code 556. They are aggrieved by
the direction contained in paragraph 33 of the impugned
judgment. They apprehend that if the merit-list is re-
drawn by including those who were otherwise ineligible
under the 2014 Rules, they may go out of the merit-list.
Their case is thus identical to the appellants in the appeal
arising out of SLP (C) No. 730 of 2022.
       In this appeal, I.A. No. 77624 of 2022 has been filed
to bring on record an application filed by one of the
candidates under the advertisement for Post Code 556 to
initiate contempt proceeding against the State for non-
compliance of the directions contained in the impugned
judgment of the High Court.

(E)    Arising out of SLP (C) No. 17676 of 2022:
       This appeal is by those who have applied under the
third advertisement dated 21.09.2020 qua Code 817. Their
grievance is that if the direction given in paragraphs 33
and 34 of impugned judgment is implemented, the
number of posts advertised would get reduced thereby
affecting their chances of selection.

Interim Orders               passed           during   pendency    of     the
proceedings:

13.        In Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022, on
12.01.2022, an interim order was passed putting in
abeyance the direction contained in paragraph 33 of the
impugned judgment. Likewise, in SLP (C) No. 17676 of




 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                       Page 25 of 57
2022, an interim order was passed on 30.09.2022 putting
in abeyance the direction contained in paragraph 34 of the
impugned judgment.
14.         We have heard learned counsel for the appellants;
the learned counsel for the respondents / Intervenors and
the Advocate General of the State of Himachal Pradesh,
who appeared for the State and the Commission.

Submissions on behalf of Appellants
15.         Ms. Kaveeta Wadia, who led the arguments on
behalf of the appellants in appeals arising out of SLP (C)
Nos. 730 of 2022, 729 of 2022 and 9977 of 2022, inter alia,
submitted:
      (i)          The first and second advertisements (i.e.,
      dated 13.02.2015 and 18.10.2016) were issued during
      currency of the 2014 Rules. The 2014 Rules
      prescribed eligibility qualifications in unequivocal
      terms and the advertisements specified the same
      qualifications with a clear stipulation that candidates
      applying         thereunder             must   hold   the   requisite
      qualifications by the last date for receipt of the
      application. The last date for receipt of application
      under the first advertisement was 31.10.2015, and
      under the second advertisement it was 17.11.2016.
      Both the advertisements did not reserve the power to
      relax the eligibility criteria at any later stage. In these
      circumstances,              the         relaxation    accorded       on




 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                       Page 26 of 57
       21.08.2017, after the last date for receipt of the
       applications, was illegal.
       (ii)        The High Court erred in observing that
       relaxation was necessitated because, (a) there could
       be confusion as to the true import of the expression
       “recognized University / Institution” and (b) there
       could be institutions conducting the same course
       under a different nomenclature. These observations of
       the High Court were in ignorance of the statutory
       regime in place since 1986 vide Himachal Pradesh
       Takniki      Shiksha         Board    Act,   198611     and       the
       Regulations framed thereunder, set out below:

                  (b) “Board” means the Himachal Pradesh Takniki

          Section 13 of the 1986 Act confers power on the

                        Provided that the result of an examination
                        shall not be cancelled on the ground of a
                        bona fide error of the Board, after the expiry
                        of 90 days from the date of announcement of

                                 conducted by it and provide for the
                                 manner of their realisation;

                        (v)     to refuse affiliation of an institution-
                              (a) which does not fulfil, or is not in

                              behalf, or
                              (b) which does not or is not willing
                              to abide by the conditions of

                        withdraw affiliation of an institution not able
                        to adhere to or make a provision for
                        standards of staff, instruction equipment or
                        buildings laid down by the Board, or on its
                        failure to observe the conditions of affiliation
                        to the satisfaction of the Board;

                        (vii) to call for reports from the heads of
                        affiliated institutions in respect of any act
                        done in contravention of the rules or

                        that facilities for instructions are duly
                        provided and availed of; and

                        that may be admitted to courses of study in

                 (3) The decision of the Board in all matters

                        courses of study and that facilities for
                        instruction are duly provided and

                        admission to the examination of the

                        affiliated institution;
                        (o) withholding or cancelling results of
                        an examination conducted by the
                        Board and cancelling an examination
                        conducted by it in respect of any
                        candidate;
                        (p) the circumstances under which
                        affiliation of an institution may be
                        withdrawn or refused;
                        (q) inspection of a centre; and (r) any
                        other matter which under this Act or
                        rules made thereunder is to be or may
                        be prescribed by regulations.”


          Section 31 of the Act provides that first Regulations
    shall be made by the State. It provides:
                 “31. First regulations of the Board.-
                 (1) The First Regulations shall be made by the
                 State Government and they shall be deemed to

                      have been made by the Board and continue in
                      force until altered or modified by the Board.

                      (2) The regulations made under sub-section (1)
                      shall not take effect until these have been
                      published in the Official Gazette”


             In exercise of its statutory powers, the Takniki
       Board framed and notified Himachal Takniki Shiksha
       Board, Regulations 199312 under Section 15 read with
       Section 31 of the 1986 Act. Regulation 6(5) of the 1993
       Regulations provided for conferment of Certificates
       and Diplomas while Regulation 7 prescribed the
       conditions for affiliation of the Institution. Further,
       Regulation 6 (5) provided that:
                      “All diplomas and certificates issued by the
                      Board, NCVT and SCVT will stand automatically
                      recognized by the Government of Himachal
                      Pradesh for the purposes of employment in
                      Subordinate services.”


             By placing reliance on the aforesaid statutory
       provisions and regulations, it was urged that the State
       was under an obligation to bring the statutory regime
       to the notice of the High Court so as to remove doubts,
       if any, about the true import of the phrase “recognized
       institution” as it occurs in the 2014 Rules.
              (iii)         In addition to the above, the State had
              notified Himachal Pradesh Private Educational
              Institutions (Regulatory Commission) Act, 201013
              which established a Regulatory Commission and

     1993 Regulations
13
     2010 Act




Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                    Page 33 of 57
              prescribed a regulatory framework for ensuring
              appropriate standard of admission, teaching,
              examination, research and protection of interest
              of students in Private Educational Institutions
              and for matters connected therewith or incidental
              thereto.
              (iv)         Further, vide letter dated 23.05.2017,
              the Director of Higher Education provided a list of
              Institutes recognised by the Takniki Board. Even
              RTI       noting   records     that   vide   letter   dated
              14.06.2017 the Director, Technical Education had
              provided details of all such institutes. Thus, there
              was neither any ambiguity in the 2014 Rules nor
              any doubt about the recognised institutes. Hence,
              no relaxation / clarification was required.
              (v)          The relaxation order dated 21.08.2017
              was a colourable exercise of powers to push
              forward a list of unrecognised institutes having
              support of powerful lobbies.
              (vi)         Impugned relaxation being after the last
              date fixed for receipt of the application is in teeth
              of the law settled by this Court in Rakesh Kumar
              Sharma vs. State (NCT of Delhi) & Ors14. That
              apart, in absence of power reserved in the
              advertisement to relax the eligibility criteria, and
              there being no publicity of such relaxation,
              relaxation of the eligibility criteria falls foul of the

14
     (2013) 11 SCC 58




Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                     Page 34 of 57
            law laid down by this Court in Bedanga Talukdar
            vs. Saifudaullah Khan15 and Sanjay K. Dixit v.
            State of U.P.16
            (vii)         Further, a candidate by self-declaration
            cannot certify his own qualification as equivalent
            to the one specified. There have to be norms and
            guidelines for declaring a qualification equivalent
            to meet the eligibility criteria prescribed by the
            Rules for the post. However, the Committee
            approved         the      candidature       /    selection      of
            candidates on the basis of self-certification which
            is impermissible in light of this Court’s decision in
            Mukul Kumar Tyagi vs. State of U.P.17
            (viii)        As relaxation of eligibility criteria was
            illegal, extension of the same relaxation for Post
            Code 556 is also illegal. Otherwise also, executive
            instructions         cannot      override   statutory      rules
            framed under Article 309 of the Constitution of
            India.      In this regard, reliance was placed on
            decisions of this Court in Krishna Rai v. Banaras
            Hindu        University18;         Union        of   India      vs
            Somasundaram Viswanath & Ors.19; and P.D.

16.           Ms. Vandana Sehgal, who appeared on behalf of
appellants in the appeal arising out of SLP (C) No.17676 of
2022, submitted that the third advertisement for Post
Code 817 was published on 21.09.2020. By that time
Himachal Pradesh, Department of Personnel, Junior Office
Assistant              (Information    Technology),   Class   III   (Non-
Gazetted) Ministerial Services, Common Recruitment and
Promotion Rules, 202021 were already notified. Thus,
recruitment had to be as per the 2020 Rules. The third
advertisement              also   applied     the   same   2020     Rules;
therefore, recruitment could not have been in terms of the
2014 Rules. Thus, relaxation under the 2014 Rules could
not have been used to fill up posts advertised under the
third advertisement. Therefore, High Court’s direction to
segregate the posts that were carried forward from the
second advertisement and hold recruitment under the old
Rules was completely misconceived. More so, when
employer cannot be forced to fill all notified vacancies as
per old Rules.

Submissions on behalf of respondents
17.           Mr. Vivek Narayan Sharma, who appeared for
respondent no.7 in SLP (C) No.730, respondent no.5 in
SLP (C) No.729 of 2022 and applicants in I.A. No.26627 of
2022 filed in SLP (C) No.730 of 2022 and I.A. No.73507 of
2022 filed in SLP (C) No. 730 of 2022, submitted:

      the 2020 Rules




 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                   Page 36 of 57
       (i)              The    High          Court     justifiably      upheld
       clarifications dated 21.08.2017 and 19.03.2018;
       (ii)             The respondent(s) are eligible in terms of the
       aforesaid clarifications;
       (iii)            The   argument         that    to   be   considered
       recognised, an institution must have recognition from
       the Takniki Board has been raised for the first time in
       rejoinder before this Court, therefore, it cannot be
       entertained at this stage;
       (iv)             The appointments under Post Code 556 were
       subject to the outcome of the litigation, therefore the
       appointees have no right to challenge the decision of
       the High Court;
       (v)              The prescribed essential qualification is in
       fact a non-essential qualification, inasmuch as
       selection is made after undergoing rigorous selection
       process such as written test, typing test and interview.
       Therefore, Diploma is not an essential qualification;
       (vi)             The term recognized institution occurring in
       the 2014 Rules is ambiguous and, therefore, required
       clarification. In this regard, reliance was placed on a
       decision of this Court in Dhananjay Malik vs. State
       of Uttaranchal22 ;
       (vii)            Rule 18 conferred power on the State to relax
       the       Rules.       Consultation           with   Public     Service
       Commission was not required because under the
       proviso to Article 320 (3) of the Constitution, “The

22
     (2008) 4 SCC 171




Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                           Page 37 of 57
        Himachal            Pradesh     Public   Service   Commission
        (Exemption from Consultation) Regulations, 1973”
        were framed and, as per Regulation 3 thereof, there is
        exemption from consultation in respect of services and
        posts specified in the Schedule. Class III posts, other
        than those specified, are exempt from consultation.
        Thus, relaxation without consultation with                   the
        Commission was legally permissible. In this regard,
        reliance was placed on a decision of this Court in the
        case of State of Gujarat vs. Arvindkumar T.
        Tiwari23..
18.           On behalf of the State of Himachal Pradesh, H.P.
Staff Selection Commission and the Govt. of Himachal
Pradesh, Mr. Anup Kumar Rattan, Advocate General,
assisted by Abhinav Mukerji, submitted:
        (i)              Under the first advertisement for Post Code
        447 there were 1421 vacancies. In respect of second
        advertisement for Post Code 556 there were 1156
        vacancies. Both advertisements were, inter alia, for the
        post(s) of JOA, Class-III (Non-Gazetted) Ministerial
        Service, and were to be filled as per the 2014 Rules. A
        large number of candidates applied under any one of
        the following categories:
               (a) Those who held qualification higher than the
               one prescribed;
 23
      (2012) 9 SCC 545




Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                   Page 38 of 57
           (b) Those who held qualifications from institute(s)
           regarding which there was ambiguity as to how
           they could be treated as recognised;
           (c) Those who held qualifications equivalent to the
           prescribed qualifications; and
           (d) Those who held prescribed qualifications from
           recognized institutes.
           Initially, candidature of all those who did not fulfil
    the eligibility criteria as per 2014 Rules was rejected.
    However, several of them approached the Tribunal. On
    30.06.2017, in O.A. No.2830 of 2017, the Tribunal
    passed an interim order that candidates holding one
    year diploma, though with a different nomenclature
    than the one prescribed, may be considered subject to
    decision of the State Government on its equivalence
    with the one prescribed. Pursuant thereto, on
    21.08.2017             the      State    Government   issued      a
    clarification that all candidates having one year
    diploma in computer or higher education in Computer
    Science / Application / IT from any private institution
    may also be considered for selection.
    (ii)          The letter dated 21.08.2017 is clarificatory in
    nature and within the scope of powers conferred by
    Rule 18 of the 2014 Rules, and was necessitated on
    account of ambiguity in the 2014 Rules. The
    clarification widens the zone of consideration by
    including those who were successful in the written




Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                 Page 39 of 57
       examination and typing test, therefore, it causes no
       prejudice to the interest of the State.
       (iii)            The clarification was approved by the State
       cabinet in its meeting held on 18.09.2017, which had
       the power to relax the Rules under Rule 18 of the 2014
       Rules. Such relaxation could be without consultation
       of the Commission in light of Regulation 3 of the 1973
       Regulations. Moreover, the clarification was issued in
       public interest considering the urgency to fill the
       vacant posts.
       (iv)             The State Govt. vide letter dated 19.03.2018
       directed           the    Commission           to    implement      the
       clarification dated 21.08.2017 in respect of Post Code
       556 also, as both (i.e., Post Code 447 and Post Code
       556) required same set of qualifications and were to
       be filled under the 2014 Rules.
       (v)              The     State    has        power     to   prescribe
       qualifications            for    the        recruitment.    Essential
       qualifications for appointment to a post are for the
       employer to prescribe and the question of equivalence
       falls outside the domain of judicial review. In this
       regard, reliance was placed on a decision of this Court
       in Maharashtra Public Service Commission vs.
       Sandeep Sudhakarrao Lavhekar24.
       (vi)             The     State        can    even     withdraw       an
       advertisement and proceed afresh under new set of
       Rules. In this regard, reliance was placed on a decision

24
     (2019) 6 SCC 362




Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                         Page 40 of 57
         of this Court in State of M.P. vs. Raghuveer Singh
         Yadav25
         (vii)          Recruitment           under   Post   Code    447      is
         complete. If the appointments are set aside, it would
         create administrative chaos. In the recruitment
         process under Post Code 556, out of 1156 posts that
         were advertised, 626 posts have been filled and 530
         posts remain unfilled.
19.            On behalf of Intervenors (I.A. No.100627 of 2022),
who claim to possess qualifications higher than prescribed
by the Rules, Mr. Tarun Gupta argued that they possess
qualifications which can be considered higher than the
prescribed qualifications and, therefore, they ought to
have been considered as eligible even though qua them no
specific clarification was issued. Further, if persons having
diploma from private / unrecognised institutes were
considered eligible, there could be no dispute regarding
eligibility of those who possess higher qualification. The
learned counsel sought to distinguish the decision of this
Court in Zahoor Ahmad Rather & Ors. vs. Sheikh
Imtiyaz Ahmad & Ors.26 relied by the High Court to reject
their claim.
20.            Mr. Dinesh Singh, who appeared for one of the
selected candidates for Post Code 447, submitted that
there exists no authority to recognise a private institute in
the State. Considering this, the State Government


25
     (1994) 6 SCC 151
26
     (2019) 2 SCC 404




     Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                     Page 41 of 57
considered registered institutes as recognised institutes.
Moreover, selected candidates were appointed after
undergoing tests and they have been working since long
and     have       also      been       regularised.   Therefore,     their
appointment must not be disturbed.

Discussion and Analysis
21.          We have considered the rival submissions and
have perused the record.
22.          The facts as regards which there exist no dispute
are:
       (a)         that      recruitment       under    the   first     two
advertisements relating to Post Code 447 and 556 were to
be made when the 2014 Rules were in vogue and validity
of which has not been questioned by any of the parties;
       (b)         that the first two advertisements prescribed
same eligibility qualifications as prescribed by the 2014
Rules;
       (c)         that        the        advertisements      specifically
stipulated that candidates must hold prescribed essential
qualifications by the last date for receipt of application or
by the date specified therein;
       (d)         that relaxation / clarification order was
issued without consultation with the Himachal Pradesh
Public Service Commission; and
       (e)         that when the relaxation order or clarificatory
letter, as the case may be, was issued, the last date for




 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                     Page 42 of 57
receipt of application under the two advertisements had
passed.

Issues:
23.           In the aforesaid factual backdrop, the crucial
issues that arise for our consideration are:
       (i)         Whether relaxation in the essential eligibility
      qualifications could be made post the last date fixed
      for receipt of application from the candidates?
      (ii)         Whether the essential eligibility qualifications
      specified in the 2014 Rules were ambiguous as to
      warrant clarification or relaxation with a view to
      declare certain other qualifications as equivalent to
      the one specified in the said Rules?
      (iii)        Whether there was a statutory regime in place
      to accord recognition to an Institution? If yes, whether
      the clarificatory letter / relaxation order is in
      ignorance of such statutory regime and is, therefore,
      invalid?
      (iv)         Whether, in absence of prior consultation
      with the Commission, the relaxation / clarificatory
      order could be considered in conformity with the
      provisions of Rule 18 of the 2014 Rules?
      (v)          Whether in view of requirement for a written
      and computer typing test prior to selection, possession
      of one year diploma in Computer Science / Computer
      Application          /     Information   Technology    from      a
      recognised University / Institution by a candidate was
      not an essential eligibility qualification?

 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                 Page 43 of 57
      (vi)         Whether candidates holding qualifications
      other than the one prescribed by the 2014 Rules or
      the advertisement, though allegedly higher, could be
      considered eligible?
      (vii)        Whether the State (i.e., the employer) could
      be forced to fill all vacancies advertised; and whether
      it could be restrained from carrying it forward for
      filling it as per the amended / new Rules.

Issue No.(i)
24.          It is well settled that eligibility criteria / conditions,
unless provided otherwise in the extant rules or the
advertisement, must be fulfilled by the candidate by the
last date for receipt of applications specified in the
advertisement [See: Rakesh Kumar Sharma (supra)].

25.          In Bedanga Talukdar (supra), this Court observed:
                  “29. …………… In our opinion, it is too well settled
                  to need any further reiteration that all
                  appointments to public office have to be made in
                  conformity with Article 14 of the Constitution of
                  India. In other words, there must be no
                  arbitrariness resulting from any undue favour
                  being shown to any candidate. Therefore, the
                  selection process has to be conducted strictly in
                  accordance with the stipulated selection
                  procedure. Consequently, when a particular
                  schedule is mentioned in an advertisement, the
                  same has to be scrupulously maintained. There
                  cannot be any relaxation in the terms and
                  conditions of the advertisement unless such a
                  power is specifically reserved. Such a power could
                  be reserved in the relevant statutory rules. Even
                  if power of relaxation is provided in the rules, it
                  must still be mentioned in the advertisement. In
                  the absence of such power in the rules, it could
                  still be provided in the advertisement. However,




 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                   Page 44 of 57
                  the power of relaxation, if exercised, has to be
                  given due publicity. This would be necessary to
                  ensure that those candidates who become eligible
                  due to the relaxation, are afforded an equal
                  opportunity to apply and compete. Relaxation of
                  any condition in advertisement without due
                  publication would be contrary to the mandate of
                  equality contained in Articles 14 and 16 of the
                  Constitution of India.
                  30. A perusal of the advertisement in this case
                  will clearly show that there was no power of
                  relaxation. In our opinion, the High Court
                  committed an error in directing that the condition
                  with regard to the submission of the disability
                  certificate either along with the application form or
                  before appearing in the preliminary examination
                  could be relaxed in the case of Respondent 1.
                  Such a course would not be permissible as it
                  would violate the mandate of Articles 14 and 16
                  of the Constitution of India.
                  32. ………. It is settled law that there can be no
                  relaxation in the terms and conditions contained
                  in the advertisement unless the power of
                  relaxation is duly reserved in the relevant rules
                  and/or in the advertisement. Even if there is a
                  power of relaxation in the rules, the same would
                  still have to be specifically indicated in the
                  advertisement. …………..”

                                              (Emphasis supplied)

26.        The above decision has been followed in Sanjay K.
Dixit (supra). Thus, the law is settled that if the extant
Rules provide for the power to relax the eligibility criteria,
the same could be exercised only if such power is reserved
in the advertisement. And when this power is exercised,
there must be wide publicity of its exercise so that persons
who are likely to benefit by exercise of such power may get
opportunity to apply and compete.
27.        In the instant case, it is not shown that the
advertisement reserved the power to relax the essential




 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                     Page 45 of 57
eligibility qualifications specified in the advertisement at
any later stage. Rather, the advertisement is specific that
eligibility criteria must be fulfilled by an aspiring candidate
by the last date fixed for receipt of the application. It is not
demonstrated that after the decision to relax the eligibility
criteria was taken, the same was widely publicised, and
the last date to apply under the advertisement was
extended to enable persons benefited by such relaxation
to apply and compete. In these circumstances, in our view,
the power to relax the eligibility criteria, even if it existed,
was not exercised in consonance with the settled legal
principles and it violated the constitutional mandate
enshrined in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Issue
No.(i) is decided in the terms above.

Issue Nos.(ii), (iii) and (iv):
28.        As issue nos. (ii), (iii) and (iv) are interrelated we
propose to deal with them simultaneously. First, we shall
consider whether there is any ambiguity in the essential
eligibility qualifications specified in the 2014 Rules.
29.        As per Rule 7 of the 2014 Rules, “one year diploma
in    Computer           Science         /    Computer   Application     /
Information Technology from a recognized University /
Institution” was one of the essential qualifications which
an aspiring candidate was required to possess to be
eligible for the post. According to the High Court, it was
ambiguous because “recognized Institution” was not
defined. Therefore, to provide clarity as to what was a




 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                   Page 46 of 57
recognized Institution, under orders of the Tribunal, the
relaxation / clarification order dated 21.08.2017 was
issued. According to the appellants, this exercise was not
acceptable because there existed a statutory regime in the
2010      Act     and       the     Regulations       framed     thereunder
empowering a Takniki Board to accord recognition /
affiliation to institutes awarding diploma / certificate on
successful completion of such courses. It is their case that
the State did not place the statutory regime before the
High Court and, therefore, the High Court overlooked the
same while accepting the plea of ambiguity in the 2014
Rules.
30.        On perusal of the record we could not find that the
clarificatory / relaxation order providing equivalence to
certain courses was founded on empirical data that
courses identical, or by and large identical, to the one
specified in the extant Rules were being conducted by
various recognized institutions or Universities under
different nomenclatures. In fact, what the clarificatory or
relaxation order does is that it proceeds to impliedly
recognize certain courses / diploma obtained from a
private Institution, like from a society registered under
Societies Registration Act or Rashtriya Saksharta Mission
IT program / Skill Development Program, without
examining whether under the extant statutory regime they
could be considered recognized.
31.        In our view, if there existed a statutory procedure
for   granting         recognition,           an   Institution   cannot    be




 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                       Page 47 of 57
considered recognized dehors that procedure. No doubt,
as held by a Constitution Bench of this Court in
Mohammad Shujat Ali & Ors. vs. Union of India &
Ors.27, issue of equivalence is a technical issue and where
the decision of the Government is based on the
recommendation of an expert body, the Court should not
lightly disturb its decision unless it is based on extraneous
or irrelevant considerations or actuated by mala fides or is
irrational and perverse or manifestly wrong. But this is not
a case of mere treating degrees or certificates obtained
from a recognized Institution / University as equivalent to
the one specified, rather it is of granting recognition to
certain courses conducted by private institutes, whether
recognized or not as per the extant statutory regime. This,
in our view, amounts to changing the eligibility criteria
midway because the extant Rules and the advertisement
both stipulated that the diploma / specified course had to
be from a recognized Institution / University. Even
assuming that there had been no statutory procedure
prescribed to accord recognition, such relaxation in the
eligibility         qualification          ought   to   have   been   widely
publicized, and opportunity should have been afforded to
those who were left out, so that they could apply and
compete, as held by this Court in Bank of India vs. Aarya
K. Babu28.

     Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                   Page 48 of 57
32.        In Aarya K. Babu (supra), one of the issues was,
whether a particular educational qualification made
eligible after issue of recruitment notification could have
been      considered          for    the      purposes   of   recruitment.
Answering the question, this Court held that if there is any
change in the qualification criteria after the notification is
issued but before the completion of the selection process,
and the employer/ recruiting agency seeks to adopt the
change, it will be incumbent on the employer to issue a
corrigendum incorporating the changes to the notification
and invite application from those qualified as per the
changed criteria and consider the same along with the
applications received in response to the initial notification.
We respectfully agree with the above view as it is in
consonance with the constitutional mandate.
33.        In this view of the matter, even if we assume that
the State had power to relax the eligibility criteria, the
same could not have been done mid-stream without giving
wide publicity of such change, and opportunity to similarly
situated candidates to apply and compete with others.
34.        As there appears nothing on record to indicate that
wide publicity of such relaxation in the specified
qualifications was made, and opportunity was afforded to
similarly situated candidates to apply and compete, in our
view, considering the manner in which the relaxation was
accorded, the same falls foul of the constitutional mandate
enshrined in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Issue
Nos.(ii), (iii) and (iv) are answered in the above terms.

 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                      Page 49 of 57
Issue No.(v):
35.        A plain reading of the 2014 Rules and the
advertisement would indicate that possession of one year
diploma in Computer Science/ Computer Application/
Information Technology from a recognised University/
Institution is an essential qualification which must be
possessed by a candidate desirous of appointment on the
post concerned. The High Court has also not treated the
same as a non-essential qualification. In this view of the
matter, we reject the argument that requirement to hold
one year diploma in the specified courses was not an
essential qualification. Issue No.(v) is decided accordingly.
Issue No.(vi):
36.        The 2014 Rules as well as the advertisement in
clear terms prescribed the essential qualification as
follows:
                  “(i)  10 +2 from a recognised Board of School
                  Education/ University.
                  (ii)  One year Diploma in Computer Science/
                  Computer Application/ Information Technology
                  from a recognised University/ Institution.
                  (iii) Computer typing speed of 30 words per
                  minute in English or 25 words per minute in Hindi
                                         OR

                  (i)    10 +2 from a recognised Board of School
                  Education/ University.
                  (ii)   “O” or “A” level Diploma from National
                  Institute of Electronics & Information Technology
                  (NIELET)
                  (iii)  Computer typing speed of 30 words per
                  minute in English or 25 words per minute in
                  Hindi”




 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                  Page 50 of 57
37.        Neither the 2014 Rules nor the advertisement
recognises any other, or higher qualification, meeting the
eligibility criteria specified therein. In a somewhat similar
situation, in Zahoor Ahmad Rather (supra), this Court
held:
                  “26. ………….. Absent such a rule, it would not be
                  permissible to draw an inference that a higher
                  qualification    necessarily       presupposes       the
                  acquisition of another, albeit lower, qualification.
                  The prescription of qualifications for a post is a
                  matter of recruitment policy. The State as the
                  employer is entitled to prescribe the qualifications
                  as a condition of eligibility. It is no part of the role
                  or function of judicial review to expand upon the
                  ambit of the prescribed qualifications. Similarly,
                  equivalence of a qualification is not a matter
                  which can be determined in exercise of the power
                  of judicial review. Whether a particular
                  qualification should or should not be regarded as
                  equivalent is a matter for the State, as the
                  recruiting authority, to determine. The decision
                  in Jyoti K.K. [Jyoti K.K. v. Kerala Public Service
                  Commission, (2010) 15 SCC 596 : (2013) 3 SCC
                  (L&S) 664] turned on a specific statutory rule
                  under which the holding of a higher qualification
                  could presuppose the acquisition of a lower
                  qualification. The absence of such a rule in the
                  present case makes a crucial difference to the
                  ultimate outcome. …..
                  27. While prescribing the qualifications for a post,
                  the State, as employer, may legitimately bear in
                  mind several features including the nature of the
                  job, the aptitudes requisite for the efficient
                  discharge of duties, the functionality of a
                  qualification and the content of the course of
                  studies which leads up to the acquisition of a
                  qualification. The State is entrusted with the
                  authority to assess the needs of its public
                  services. Exigencies of administration, it is trite
                  law, fall within the domain of administrative
                  decision-making. The State as a public employer
                  may well take into account social perspectives
                  that require the creation of job opportunities
                  across the societal structure. All these are
                  essentially matters of policy. Judicial review must

                  tread warily. That is why the decision in Jyoti
                  K.K. [Jyoti    K.K. v. Kerala     Public     Service
                  Commission, (2010) 15 SCC 596 : (2013) 3 SCC
                  (L&S) 664] must be understood in the context of a
                  specific statutory rule under which the holding of
                  a higher qualification which presupposes the
                  acquisition of a lower qualification was
                  considered to be sufficient for the post. It was in
                  the context of specific rule that the decision
                  in Jyoti K.K. [Jyoti K.K. v. Kerala Public Service
                  Commission, (2010) 15 SCC 596 : (2013) 3 SCC
                  (L&S) 664] turned.”

                                                    (Emphasis supplied)

38.        In light of the law above, since we find that there
exists     no      provision         in       the    extant   Rules     or    the
advertisement to treat any other qualification as higher or
equivalent to the one specified therein, the claim of such
candidates, who could not demonstrate that they held the
prescribed essential qualifications, is liable to be rejected
and has rightly been rejected by the High Court as well.
Issue No.(vi) is decided accordingly.

Issue No. (vii):
39.        It is well settled that an employer cannot be forced
to fill all the existing vacancies under the old Rules. The
employer may, in a given situation, withdraw an
advertisement           and      issue        a     fresh   advertisement       in
conformity with the new or amended Rules [See: State of
M.P. vs. Raghuveer Singh Yadav (supra)]. Even a
candidate included in the merit list has no indefeasible
right to appointment even if the vacancy exists (See:

 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                           Page 52 of 57
 Shankarsan Dash vs. Union of India29). Issue No.(vii) is
decided accordingly.

Conclusion / Directions:
40.            For     all    the      reasons     above,   the     direction(s)
contained in paragraphs 33 and 34 of the impugned
judgment of the High Court setting aside the closure of the
selection process for Post Code 556 and to re-cast the
merit list as well as fill up remaining posts of Post Code
556, with the aid of relaxation/ clarification dated
21.08.2017/ 18.09.2017 read with communication dated
19.03.2018, after segregating it from those advertised as
Post Code 817, are set aside. Though the directions
contained therein were stayed by this Court, yet, as a
matter            of      abundant            caution,   we       direct     that
appointment(s), if any, made by taking aid of those
directions, would stand set aside by this order.
41.            As regards those candidates who were appointed
under the first advertisement qua Post Code 447 not
pursuant to the impugned judgment, but by the State
itself, based on the relaxation accorded vide order dated
21.08.2017, the contention of the appellants in the appeal
arising out of SLP (C) No.4321 of 2022 is, that out of 1421
posts advertised, 809 candidates appointed did not hold
qualifications as per the 2014 Rules; they got selected only
because of the illegal relaxation order. Further, by now at
least 73 posts under Post Code 447 have fallen vacant,


29
     (1991) 3 SCC 47




     Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                       Page 53 of 57
either due to resignation by the appointed candidates or
otherwise, while there are only 29 SLP petitioners waiting
for their chances. It is thus prayed on behalf of these
appellants that they be considered for appointment.
42.        Before we proceed to notice the response to the
above contentions, it may be noted that, though in SLP (C)
No. 4321 of 2022 all such candidates whose qualification
has been challenged are impleaded, as per office report
dated 23.03.2023, notices were not served on them
directly, rather it was served through Respondent no.1
(State of H.P.). Further, from the record it appears that
O.A. No.5543 of 2017, out of which SLP (C) No.4321 of
2022 arises, was filed by initially impleading only two
selected candidates as would be clear from the date chart
submitted by the SLP petitioners. Otherwise also, in O.A.
No.5543 of 2017, it has not been specifically disclosed as
to how those candidates were ineligible. Therefore, even if
we assume that all those selected candidates were
impleaded later, it is not clear, firstly, whether they were
served with notice of the proceedings before the High Court
or the Tribunal, and, secondly, whether any foundation
was laid before the High Court or Tribunal to individually
question their eligibility qualification.
43.        In the above backdrop, on behalf of the State–
respondents it is contended that such appointments were
made under the first advertisement more than five to six
years ago. Such appointees have not only passed the
written test but have also cleared computer typing test.

 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022       Page 54 of 57
They are Class III (Non-gazetted) employees who, by virtue
of long experience, have not only gained adequate
proficiency in their job but are now placed in various
departments of the State. Therefore, if their appointment
is disturbed, it would paralyse the Govt. set up. Moreover,
several of such candidates might have crossed maximum
age limit for participating in a fresh recruitment exercise.
It is, therefore, prayed by the respondents that their
appointment(s) should not be disturbed in exercise of
discretionary powers of this Court.
44.        Upon consideration of the rival submissions and
having regard to: (a) that appointments were made after
taking written and computer typing test of the candidates;
(b) that there is no specific allegation of nepotism or mala
fides in making such appointments; (c) that nature of the
post does not require a high degree of technical skill; (d)
the length of period during which the appointments have
continued; and (e) that there is no clarity whether such
appointees were duly served with notice of the proceeding
before the High Court, or whether a specific challenge was
laid to their eligibility individually, we are of the considered
view that even if such appointments were made taking aid
of the relaxation order dated 21.08.2017, it would not be
in the interest of justice to disturb those appointments
made under the first advertisement (Post Code 447). As
regards adjustment of the appellants (i.e., petitioners in
SLP (C) No. 4321 of 2022) against vacancies that might
have arisen subsequent to appointment against the




 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022          Page 55 of 57
advertised vacancies is concerned, in our view, it would
not be appropriate as those vacancies would have to be
filled after a fresh advertisement and in accordance with
the extant Rules.
45.          In light of the aforesaid discussion and conclusion,
we direct / order as under:
      (i)         The relaxation / clarificatory order dated
      21.08.2017, as approved by the State cabinet on
      18.09.2017, being after the last date fixed by the
      advertisements dated 13.02.2015 (i.e., for Post Code
      447) and dated 18.10.2016 (for Post Code 556) for
      receipt of applications from candidates, is not legally
      sustainable qua those posts (i.e., Post Codes 447 and
      556), particularly, when no opportunity was afforded
      to similarly placed persons, who might have been left
      out, to apply and compete with those candidates who,
      though       not     eligible      as   per    the    terms     of    the
      advertisement, had applied thereunder;
      (ii)        The direction(s) contained in paragraphs 33
      and 34 of the impugned judgment of the High Court
      setting aside the closure of the selection process for
      Post Code 556 and to re-cast the merit list as well as
      fill up remaining posts of Post Code 556, with the aid
      of      relaxation/        clarification      dated    21.08.2017/
      18.09.2017           read        with    communication             dated
      19.03.2018, after segregating it from those advertised
      as Post Code 817, are set aside. In consequence, (a)
      the      merit      list      prepared        under    the       second




Special Leave Petition (C) No. 730 of 2022                          Page 56 of 57
      advertisement for Post Code 556 shall not be re-drawn
      by including such candidates who, though not eligible,
      became eligible pursuant to relaxation / clarificatory
      order dated 21.08.2017 / 18.09.2017 read with com-
      munication dated 19.03.2018; and (b) there shall be
      no segregation of seats advertised under the third ad-
      vertisement dated 21.09.2020 for Post Code 817.
      Thus, recruitment for Post Code 817 shall be strictly
      in accordance with the extant Rules (i.e., 2020 Rules),
      as notified.
      (iii)        The appointments already made under the
      first advertisement (for Post Code 447) shall not be
      disturbed merely because some of the appointees may
      have gained eligibility based on the order of relaxation
      / clarification dated 21.08.2017, which was approved
      by the State cabinet.
46.           All the appeals are disposed of in the aforesaid
terms. Pending application(s), if any, are also disposed of.
There is no order as to costs.
