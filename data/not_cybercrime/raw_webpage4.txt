                                 Date : 28/11/2023

                                  ORAL ORDER
1.       By this application filed under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., the
         applicants who are in-laws of the private respondent, seek to
         invoke inherent powers of this Court, praying for quashment of the

         under Sections 498A and 114 of the IPC and under Sections 3 and
         4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.

2.       Facts and circumstances giving rise to file this quashing petition
         are that, the applicants being father-in-law, mother-in-law and
         sister-in-laws of the private respondent, have preferred this
         petition, inter-alia stating that, the allegations of harassment having
         been made without any basis and the criminal proceedings put into
         motion with a view to harass them. The marriage of the private

     R/CR.MA/23154/2022                               ORDER DATED: 28/11/2023

                                                                                    undefined




        respondent with son of applicant nos. 1 and 2 was solemnized on
        26.01.2010 and out of the said wedlock two children were born and
        presently, they are residing with the private respondent. The
        marriage was love marriage. It is alleged that, the husband Yogesh
        Polara is not doing anything for the livelihood of the family and
        having habit of consuming liquor, as a result, the matrimonial
        disputes cropped up with the wife - private respondent. So far
        applicants are concerned, it is alleged that, since 2020, the private
        respondent was subjected to mental and physical harassment by the
        husband, however, the applicants are indirectly inciting the act of
        the harassment and failed to make out amicable resolution and did
        not care about her maintenance.

3.      In the aforesaid facts, the private respondent filed a criminal
        proceedings under the aforementioned offences, implicating five
        persons as accused.

4.      After registration of the FIR, the applicants have preferred present
        quashing petition mainly on the ground that, the allegations made
        in the FIR even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in
        their entirety, do not prima-facie constitute any offence or make
        out a case against them.

5.      This Court has heard learned counsel Mr. Yogendra Thakore and
        Ms. Maithili Mehta, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the
        respondent State. Private respondent, though served, did not choose
        to remain present.

     R/CR.MA/23154/2022                                ORDER DATED: 28/11/2023

                                                                                     undefined




6.      Mr. Thakore, learned counsel appearing for the applicants has
        submitted that, after 11 years of the marriage, the questioned FIR
        has been lodged, wherein, the entire family members roped into,
        without any instances of harassment, except general and omnibus
        allegations made with a view to harass them. He would further that
        the father-in-law and mother-in-law, aged about 69 and 63 are
        citizen of USA and since long, they are living separately and
        enjoying their life in USA. So far sister-in-laws are concerned, Mr.
        Thakore submitted that, both the sisters are living separately at
        their respective matrimonial home and they never lived together
        and shared the house with the private respondent. In these
        background facts, Mr. Thakore contended that, the ingredients of
        the alleged offence are lacking as the applicants have nothing to do
        with the alleged harassment at the instance of husband accused and
        therefore, this is a fit case to exercise inherent powers to quash the
        criminal proceedings.

7.      The respondent no. 2 - original informant, though served, has
        chosen not to remain present in the proceedings nor, has filed reply
        affidavit to oppose the prayer of quashing.

8.      On the other hand, learned Additional Public Prosecutor Ms.
        Maithili Mehta, vehemently opposed the plea of quashing and
        contended that, this is not an exceptional case to exercise inherent
        powers of this Court and when, the averments of the FIR disclosed
        the ingredients necessary to constitute an offence, the Court should
        not exercise its power to stifle a legitimate prosecution.

9.       The scope and power of the High Court to quash the first
         information report is well settled. The power under Section 482 of
         the Code has to be exercised sparingly and cautiously to prevent
         the abuse of process of Court and to secure the ends of justice. The
         High Court should refrain from giving a prima-facie decision,
         unless there are compelling circumstances to do so. Taking the
         allegations, as they are, without adding or subtracting anything, if
         no offence is made out, only then, the High Court would be
         justified in quashing the proceedings in the exercise of its power
         under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

10.      The Apex Court in case of State of Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal
         reported in (1992) Supp 1 SCC 335 has laid down the guidelines
         that must be adhered to while exercising inherent powers under
         Sections 482 of the Code to quash the criminal proceedings. The
         relevant paragraph reads thus:

                 "102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various
                 relevant provisions of the Code under Chapter XIV and of
                 the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a series of
                 decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power
                 under Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482
                 of the Code which we have extracted and reproduced above,
                 we give the following categories of cases by way of
                 illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to
                 prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to
                 secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to
                 lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently
                 channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and
                 to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein
                 such power should be exercised:

           (1) Where the allegations made in the first information report
           or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value
           and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute
           any offence or make out a case against the accused.

           (2) Where the allegations in the first information report and
           other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not
           disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by
           police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except
           under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section
           155(2) of the Code.

           (3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or
           complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same
           do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out
           a case against the accused.

           (4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a
           cognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable
           offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer
           without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under
           Section 155(2) of the Code.

           (5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are
           so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which
           no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there
           is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.

           (6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of
           the provisions of the Code or the Act concerned (under
           which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution
           and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a
           specific provision in the Code or the Act concerned,
           providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the
           aggrieved party.

           (7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with
           mala fides and/or where the proceeding is maliciously
           instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on
           the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and
           personal grudge."

11.      Since the FIR in question emanates from matrimonial disputes.
       Recently, the Apex Court in case of Kahkashan Kausar @ Sonam &
       Ors. Vs. State of Bihar & Ors. reported in (2022) 6 SCC 599 held
       and observed that, in recent times, matrimonial litigation in the
       country has increased significantly which led in an increased
       tendency to employ provision such as 498A Indian Penal Code as
       instruments to settled personal scores against the husband and his
       relatives. In para-17 of the judgment, it is observed that:

                 "17. ..... this court has at numerous instances expressed
                 concern over the misuse of section 498A IPC and the
                 increased tendency of implicating relatives of the husband in
                 matrimonial disputes, without analyzing the long term
                 ramifications of a trial on the complainant as well as the
                 accused. It is further manifest from the said judgments that
                 false implication by way of general omnibus allegations
                 made in the course of matrimonial dispute, if left unchecked
                 would result in misuse of the process of law. Therefore, this
                 court by way of its judgments has warned the courts from
                 proceeding against the relatives and in-laws of the husband
                 when no prima facie case is made out against them.".

12. In matrimonial case, the Apex Court in the case of Preeti Gupta
       and another vs. State of Jharkhand and another reported in
       (2010) 7 SCC 667 observed that, a serious relook of the entire
       provision is warranted by the legislation. It is also a matter of
       common knowledge that, exaggerated version of the incident are
       reflected in a large number of complaints. The tendency of over
       implication is also reflected in very large number of cases.

13. In the case of Geeta Mehrotra and Anr. v. State of Uttar Pradesh

                                                                                 NEUTRAL CITATION




   R/CR.MA/23154/2022                              ORDER DATED: 28/11/2023

                                                                                 undefined




    and Anr reported in (2012) 10 SCC 741, it is observed that, family
    members of the husband are being implicated without allegations of
    active involvement and they are being implicated casually.

14. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of present case, the
    issue arise for determination is whether the applicants have made out
    a case for quashing of FIR?

15. The accused husband against whom the allegations of harassment
    are being made is not before this Court. The applicant nos. 1 and 2
    being citizen of USA have settled there and since long, they are
    residing at the address mentioned in the application. The applicant
    nos. 3 and 4, who are sister-in-law of respondent no. 2 are also
    living separately as after their marriage, they never reside together
    with the private respondent. In these background facts and
    considering the allegations made in the FIR, this Court is of the
    considered view that, the applicants have been implicated in the
    alleged offence with a view to settled the matrimonial dispute for
    which the accused husband was failed to reconcile the entire
    matrimonial dispute. Thus, prima-facie, it appears that due to
    matrimonial dispute with the husband, the questioned FIR is being
    lodged roping into the mother, father and sisters of the accused
    husband without their being any active involvement in the alleged
    offence of harassment.

16. For the reasons recorded above, the accusations made in the FIR,
    even if taken into at their face value and taken in their entirety, do
    not constitute offence under Sections 498A and 114 of the IPC and

      applicants. The case is fully covered by categories (1) and (7) as
      enumerated by the Apex Court in the case of Bhajan Lal (Supra).

17. For the foregoing reasons, the application is allowed. Rule is made
      absolute to aforesaid extent. Resultantly, the FIR being CR. I No.
      11206043220635 of 2022 registered with Mehsana Taluka Police
