Sharafat Khan vs State Of U.P. on 19 November, 2022Bench: Shree Prakash Singh





HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD, LUCKNOW BENCH
 
 

?Court No. - 27
 

 
Case :- CRIMINAL MISC. BAIL APPLICATION No. - 1450 of 2021
 

 
Applicant :- Sharafat Khan
 
Opposite Party :- State of U.P.
 
Counsel for Applicant :- Devendra Nath Upadhyay
 
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
 

 
Hon'ble Shree Prakash Singh,J.

Heard learned counsel for the applicant, Sri Aniruddh Kumar Singh-I, learned A.G.A. for the State and perused the record. 

The instant bail application has been filed on behalf of the applicant with a prayer to release the applicant on bail during the trial in Case Crime No. 0005 of 2020, under Sections 419, 420, 468, 120B IPC & 66(C), 66(D) I.T Act, P.S.- Ciber Crime, District - Lucknow. 

As per version of FIR, the FIR has been lodged against unknown person who was said to be operating a false account on Facebook in name of Chief Secretary Government of U.P. Sri Rajendra Kumar Tiwari and demanded ransom. He submits that there is no cogent piece of evidence so as to connect him in the instant matter and only two mobile phones have been recovered from the possession of the present applicant. He also added that neither the account has been mentioned nor name of the present applicant was mentioned in the FIR. He added that only on hearsay the present applicant has been arrested and he has been shown to be involved in committing the offence. He next added that charge sheet has been filed and there is no possibility of applicant of fleeing away or tempering the evidence. It is specifically mentioned in paragraph 20 of the bail application that applicant has no previous criminal history. The applicant is in jail since 23.10.2020. In case he is granted bail, he will not misuse the liberty and would cooperate in the trial proceedings. 

Per contra, learned A.G.A. opposed the prayer of bail and submits that present applicant was involved in committing the offence as ransom was demanded in the name of Chief Secretary Rajesh Tiwari and, as such, he is not entitled for bail. 

Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after perusal of record, it is evident that there is no cogent piece of evidence so as to connect him in the instant matter and only two mobile phones have been recovered from the possession of the present applicant; further charge sheet has been filed and there is no possibility of applicant of fleeing away or tempering the evidence; further criminal history of the applicant has been explained aforesaid, coupled with the fact that he is languishing in jail since 23.10.2020, thus without commenting on the merits of the case, I find it a fit case for bail. 

Let the applicant-Sharafat Khan involved in the aforementioned crime be released on bail, on his furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount, to the satisfaction of the court concerned, with the following conditions:- 

(1) The applicant shall not tamper with the prosecution evidence by intimidating/ pressurizing the witnesses, or otherwise during the investigation or trial; 

(2) The applicant shall file an undertaking to the effect that he shall not seek any adjournment on the dates fixed for evidence when the witnesses are present in court. He shall remain present before the trial court on each date fixed, either personally or through his counsel. In case of his absence, without sufficient cause, the trial court may proceed against him under Section 229-A of the Indian Penal Code; 

(3) The applicant shall remain present, in person, before the trial court on the dates fixed for (i) opening of the case, (ii) framing of charge and (iii) recording of statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C.; and 
 
(4) In case, the applicant misuses the liberty of bail during trial and in order to secure his presence proclamation under Section 82 Cr.P.C. is issued and the applicant fails to appear before the court on the date fixed in such proclamation, the trial court shall initiate proceedings against him, in accordance with law under Section 174-A of the Indian Penal Code. 

The identity, status and residential proof of sureties will be verified by the court concerned and in case of breach of any of the above conditions, the court below shall be at liberty to cancel the bail and send the applicant to prison. 

It is clarified that the observations made in this order are strictly confined to the disposal of this bail application and must not be construed to have any reflection on the merits of the case.
