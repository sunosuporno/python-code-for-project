AND ETC.

     THIS PETITION HAVING BEEN HEARD AND
RESERVED ON 11.02.2016 AND COMING ON FOR
PRONOUNCEMENT      OF   ORDERS,    THIS  DAY
A.V.CHANDRASHEKARA, J., MADE THE FOLLOWING:

     ORDER ON THE BAIL APPLICATION FILED UNDER
                SECTION 439, Cr.P.C.

       Petitioners are accused nos.3 and 4 in a criminal

case ion Crime No.10/15 on the file of respondent police

station, a case registered punishable for various offences,

viz., Sections 420, 465, 466, 468, 474, I.P.C., Sections

66(C) and 66(D) of Information Technology Act and

Section 14 of the Foreigners Act, 1946. After concluding

investigation, charge sheet is filed for the above said

offences.


2.     The bail application filed in Crl.Misc.8271/15

before the II Additional Sessions Judge, Bengaluru,

(CCH.52) is dismissed vide order dated 12.1.2016 and

hence they have approached this court.            The 1st
                             3


petitioner is a Nigerian national born on 4.4.1979 and

his passport is valid from 7.10.2012 to 6.10.2017.     He

has obtained visa from this country to be in India from

15.5.2015 to 14.11.2015. The purpose for which visa is

obtained is shown as 'business.'    The 2nd petitioner is

also a Nigerian national born on 7.7.1984 and has

obtained passport valid from 8.8.2011 to 7.8.2016 and

visa was valid from 14.11.2012 to 13.5.2013.


3.   On the morning of 1.7.2015, Diwakar, police

inspector of the respondent police station, along with CID

staff, was on patrol duty within the limits of his police

station. On receipt of credible information, he went along

with his staff behind Garden City College and came to

know that one person was living in the ground floor of a

house in Sai Extension belonging to Smt.Amaravathi.

Police wanted to catch hold of him.         Somehow he

escaped.   When the police went inside the house of

Smt.Amaravathi, they found a lady who disclosed her

name as Lophia and that of her husband as Stellasteen

Hugo. They found 8 mobiles, 3 SIM cards, one laptop,

one MTS data card, 2 note books and 2 letterheads of
                             4


Airport Authority Customs, and passport of Stell Hugo.

She disclosed to them that they were being used by her

husband.   All the articles were seized.   Police came to

know that the husband of Lophia was involved in

creating false and fake documents and he used to

contact innocent people online assuring to get vehicles at

a lesser price. Police also came to know that Stellasteen

Hugo was in the habit of cheating people over mobile and

online and also used to get money to his account.


4.    During the course of investigation, police have

come to know that accused nos.3 and 4 were living in the

house of Anitha Jaiprakash at Marathhalli, Roshni

Garden, Bengaluru, and they were cheating people by

using social media.    Police came to know that these

people had also got lot of money from innocent persons.


5.    The 2nd petitioner's visa has already expired and he

has overstayed in India.   The 1st petitioner is stated to

have misused his visa in order to cheat people through

internet and social media. In spite of their best efforts,

police have not been able to apprehend accused nos.1, 2
                              5


and 5.   Therefore, they have filed charge sheet against

these petitioners.

6.    Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that

the petitioners have been in judicial custody ever since

registration of the case and that they undertake to obey

any condition which may be imposed oupon them. She

has stated that the offences are neither punishable with

death nor with imprisonment for life and they are

exclusively triable by the JMFC.


7.    Since the case on hand relates to overstay of

foreign nationals in India, learned counsel for the

petitioners was directed to implead Union of India,

Ministry of Home Affairs. Accordingly Union of India is

impleaded as respondent no.2 and Mr.Krishna S.Dixit

has taken notice of the petition.


8.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

learned HCGP and learned Additional Solicitor General

representing respondent no.2.


9.   What is argued by Mr.Krishna Dixit is that the 2nd

petitioner has been overstaying in India though his
                                  6


passport expired in 2013 and that both the petitioners

are involved in serious offences like cheating innocent

people   by   creating   false       documents   and   misusing

internet and social media. He has argued that both the

petitioners, being foreign nationals, have misused the

visa issued by our country and have violated the

provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946, Foreigners Order,

1948, Passports Act, 1967 and other allied Acts and

Rules. It is argued that these petitioners have not at all

intimated their place of residence either to the police of

Foreign Regional Registration Officer (FRRO, for short),

and thus they have violated the provisions of the

Registration of Foreigners Rules, 1992.


10.   Learned HCGP has opposed bail on the ground

that though the offences alleged are not punishable with

death or with imprisonment for life, the petitioners herein

are not entitled to bail, and that if bail is granted, it

would be as good as allowing them to stay in India

beyond the visa period which would amount to legalizing

their illegal stay.      There is a lot of force in the

submission.
                              7



11.   Police have collected sufficient material in regard

to the involvement of these petitioners in the online fraud

by misusing internet and social media and having

collected huge money.    Learned HCGP has argued that

charge sheet is already filed and the petitioners can face

trial before the competent court and that the prosecutor

would assist the court in conducting trial.


12.   Though the offences alleged are not punishable

with death or with imprisonment for life, the offences so

committed are by foreign nationals who are overstaying

in India after lapse of their visa. The 1st petitioner has

misused the visa issued to him and has indulged ini

online fraud, that too, by creating false documents and

cheating innocent people.    The 2nd petitioner has been

overstaying for more than 2 years and both of them have

violated the mandatory provisions of the Foreigners Act,

1946, Foreigners Order, 1948, Passports Act, 1967 and

other allied Acts and Rules. If they are let out on bail, it

would take many years for the court to dispose of the

matter.   On the other hand, if they are in judicial
                                     8


custody, suitable directions could be given to the

concerned court to dispose of the matter at the earliest.


13.      Apart from this, this court has already dealt with

the   aspect       of    granting    bail   to   foreign   nationals

overstaying in India and those who have misused the

purpose      for        which    visa   has      been   issued,   in

Crl.P.7904/15 (CHRISTIAN CHIDIEERE CHUKWU .v.

THE STATE OF KARNATAKA AND ANOTHER) disposed of

today.     That apart, petitioners herein have used many

SIM cards to contact innocent people and the allegation

is that they have forged certain documents and misused

mobiles and online devices.             Taking into consideration

all these, the petitioners are not entitled to be released on

bail at this stage.


14.      In the result, the following order is passed:

                                ORDER

      The bail application filed under Section 439,

Cr.P.C. is dismissed.           Notwithstanding dismissal of the

petition, the concerned court to take up the matter for

trial on priority basis and the prosecutor and learned

counsel for the petitioners to co-operate with the court in
                            9


disposing of the matter at the earliest, keeping in mind

the observations made in Crl.P.7904/15 stated supra.
