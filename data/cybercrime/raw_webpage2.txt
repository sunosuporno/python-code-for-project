                               Initially, 10-15% of the amount was paid and thereafter the phone was
                              blocked and not picked up and hence the remaining 85-90% amount was
                              cheated. The 10-15% amount was found credited from various bank
                              accounts in the name of various companies.
                              3.     The Power Bank App. and the website www.ezplan.in started
                              around March-April, 2021 and were rigorously pushed through social
                              media platforms like WhatsApp etc. People were given the impression
                              that these companies were to cater to the demand of power plugs in India
                              for charging of electric vehicles and out of the profits of the company, it
                              would share revenue with the investors and within 30-35 days, the
                              money would be doubled. During the investigation Cyber Crime Unit
                              came across two mobile apps., that is, Power Bank and EZ Plan and
                              while Power Bank App. was available on Google Play Store, the EZ Plan
                              App. was available on the website www.ezplan.in. The returns were
                              offered on an hourly and daily basis and had investment options starting
                              from â‚¹300 to several lakhs.
                              4.     The forensic analysis of the Power Bank App. revealed that it
                              projected itself as a Bengaluru based Technology Start-Up involved in
                              quick charging technology, however, the server on which the app. was
                              hosted was found to be based in China. The app. also accessed the
                              camera, external storage etc. and read the contact details of the phone.
                              Once the user was registered on the apps. he/she was repeatedly induced
                              to invest money to earn high returns. The app. also induced users to
                              invite their friends and relatives to join the app. and once someone
                              invested large amount their account was blocked by the app. thus causing
                              financial loss to the person investing.

                              were identified and analysed along with the connected mobile numbers
                              and the companies where the cheated money was transferred. It was
                              revealed that the accused persons, created a web of around 25 shell

                              transactions.      Details of the Directors of the shell companies were
                              obtained and reconnaissance operations were carried out and, in this

                              substituted Directors, namely, Hariom and Ved Chandra, who were their
                              known and neighbours and used their documents and thereafter this
                              company was used by the Chinese for circulating the money. As per the
                              investigation carried, the petitioner Rounak Kumar Bansal received a
                              sum of â‚¹50,000/- as consideration for the transfer of the company into
                              the name of Hariom and Ved Chandra.              Further, IP address details

                              and 1st June, 2021, however, the balance sheet reveals that the last
                              operation in this account was on 17th May, 2021. It appears that on
                              coming to know of the gravity of offence, the petitioner tried to check up
                              when this operation of the bank account on 21st May, 2021, 22nd May,

                              of the transactions, the petitioner Rounak Kumar Bansal received any
                              financial benefit except for this remuneration for removal of the
