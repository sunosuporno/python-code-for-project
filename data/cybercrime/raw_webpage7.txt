                       JUDGMENT

       The Detective    Inspector,      Cyber     Crime    Police

Station, COD, Bengaluru has fled the charge sheet

against the accused for the ofences punishable under

Sections 292, 3844, 3845 and 507 of IPC and 67 of

Information Technology Act, 2000.


2.     It is the case of the prosecution that, the accused

with an intention to extort money criminally intimidated

by     creating   defamatory      and    derogatory        e-mail

messages about the daughter of the complainant and

sent    those     messages   to    the    daughter        of   the

complainant to her e-mail ID on 13-11-2009 and

demanded money from her under a threat that he

would sell those e-mail to porn sites, mms brokers and

DVDs, when she did not heed to the demands, the

accused     has   uploaded   obscene      videos      from     the

intrenet by using video editing software and created a
 3                                       C.C.No.3999/2011


title called "Manjula   Wipro   Employee Chennai Hot

Girl" and sent the same on 31-12-2009 and published

the obscene information in the electronic form and

further went to Chennai and sent courier to the

complainant, containing photographs which were the

screen shots of the created video and CD containing

obscene    videos.   Under   such   circumstances,     the

complainant has fled a complaint against the accused

before the jurisdictional police. Accordingly, Cyber

Crime Police have registered the case against the

accused for the ofences punishable under Sections

292, 3845 and 507 of IPC and 67 of Information

Technology Act in Crime No.844/2010. The Investigating

Officer, after completion of investigation, has fled the

charge sheet against the accused for the alleged

ofences.
 4                                           C.C.No.3999/2011
3.   After   appearance     of   the   accused,   necessary

documents, as relied on by the prosecution, are

furnished to the accused, as provided under Section

207 of Cr.P.C. Charge for the ofences under Sections

292, 3844, 3845 and 507 of IPC and 67(A) of Information

Technology Act, 2000 has been framed and same is

read over and explained to the accused. The accused

pleaded not guilty and claims to be tried. Therefore,

the case was posted for prosecution evidence.



4.   In order to prove the guilt of the accused, during

the course of trial, C.Ws.9, 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 84, 10, 12,

13, 15, 11, 19, 20, 21, 16, 17, 22 and 23 are examined

as P.Ws.1 to 21 respectively and got marked Exs.P1 to

P55 and identifed M.Os.1 to 4.


5.     After completion of prosecution evidence, the

statement of the accused was recorded under Section
  5                                       C.C.No.3999/2011


313 of Cr.P.C. The accused has not adduced any oral

evidence on his behalf except marking two documents

as Exs.D1 and D2. Therefore, there is no oral evidence

on behalf of the accused.


6.    Heard the arguments of learned Senior A.P.P. and

counsel appearing for accused.


7. Judgments relied on by the parties.

(a) Citation relayed on by the prosecution-NIL

(b) Judgment relied on the learned counsel for accused:

      1. (2014) 10 SCC 473    (Anwar P. Vs. P.K.Bsheer

and others).


84.   The points that would arise for my consideration

are as under:

      1. Whether   the   prosecution     proves
        beyond all reasonable doubt that, the
        accused has committed the ofences
 6                                         C.C.No.3999/2011


        punishable under Sections 292, 3844,
        3845 and 507 of IPC and 74 of
        Information Technology Act?

      2. What order ?

9.    My answer to the above points are as under:

        Point No.1: In the Negative.

        Point No.2: As per fnal order, for the following:

                        REASONS


10.   Point No.1:- The contention of the prosecution is

that the accused with an intention to extort money

criminally intimidated by creating defamatory and

derogatory e-mail messages about the daughter of the

complainant and sent those messages to the daughter

of the complainant to her e-mail ID on 13-11-2009 and

demanded money from her under a threat that he

would sell those e-mail to porn sites, mms brokers and

DVDs, when she did not heed to the demands, the
 7                                            C.C.No.3999/2011


accused   has   uploaded    obscene        videos   from   the

intrenet by using video editing software and created a

title called "Manjula   Wipro    Employee Chennai          Hot

Girl" and sent the same on 31-12-2009 and published

the obscene information in the electronic form and

further went to Chennai and sent courier to the

complainant, containing photographs, which were the

screen shots of the created video and CD containing

absence   videos   and     thereby     the     accused     has

committed the ofences punishable under Sections 292,

3844, 3845 and 507 of IPC and 74 of Information

Technology Act.

11. In order to prove the guilt of the accused for the

ofences punishable under Sections 292, 3844, 3845 and

507 of IPC and 74 of Information Technology Act.,

C.W.9 is examined as P.W.1. P.W.1 is a seizure

mahazar      witness,      who       has      deposed           in
 8                                             C.C.No.3999/2011


chief-examination that the Cyber Crime Police have

summoned him to their office on 15-3-2010 and got his

signature on mahazar, which is marked as Ex.P1.                  In

chief-examination itself P.W.1 has deposed to the

following efect:

               The    police   did   not      seize
          anything through Ex.P1 in my
          presence.    Along    with    me     my
          brother Kumar has also attested
          Ex.P1.      The   police     have    not
          recorded my statement.           I know
          this much.



     The evidence of P.W.1 as above is not sufficient to

prove the seizure mahazar. When the police have not

seized anything in the presence of P.W.1, the material

object produced before the court creates a doubt.

Since P.W.1 has not supported the case of the

prosecution, he was treated as hostile witness and

cross-examined by the learned Senior APP with the
 9                                           C.C.No.3999/2011


permission   of   the   court.   But   in   the   course       of

cross-examination, all the suggestions have been

denied by P.W.1 emphatically. Moreover, nothing worth

has been elicited to prove the seizure mahazar.

Therefore, the evidence of P.W.1 is not at all sufficient

to prove the seizure mahazar,



12. The complainant/C.W.1 is examined as P.W.2. In

order to establish and to prove the guilt of the accused,

the evidence of P.W.2 is very important. In the course

of chief-examination, P.W.2 has deposed at length by

reiterating the allegations made in the complaint and

also the contentions taken in the course of complaint

as well as statements. P.W.2 has deposed with regard

to alleged ofences against the accused and got

marked complaint, photo sheets, courier invoice, letter

and print out of threatening e-mails as Exs.P3 to P84 and

identifed the alleged DVD as M.O.1. Therefore, I need
 10                                       C.C.No.3999/2011


not recapitulate facts which have been reiterated in the

course of chief-examination.


13.   In order to disprove the case of the prosecution

and to test the veracity of P.W.2, the learned counsel

for accused has cross-examined P.W.2 at length. In the

course of cross-examination, P.W.2 has categorically

admitted that the accused is the classmate of his

daughter and her daughter had so many friends both

boys and girls.   It is further deposed by P.W.2 with

regard to education qualifcation and also job secured

by his daughter in HP company. It is also admitted by

P.W.2 that the accused and his daughter and their

friends have established partnership frm called "Web

Echlon", a computer programme frm at Banashankari

III Stage, Bengaluru. This consistent and unequivocal

admission of P.W.2 further establishes and proves that

the accused and daughter of the complainant were all
 11                                             C.C.No.3999/2011


close friends and also partners of private frm. Hence,

it is clear that the daughter of the complainant and

accused had close relationship.


14. In      further    cross-examination         P.W.2      has

categorically deposed that he has received courier

service    on    29-1-2010   consisting   of    coloured     16

photographs with DVD.        It is further deposed by him

that he has watched the contents of the DVD in their

house along with his daughter on the same day

evening.    In order to establish and prove the guilt of

the accused that he has sent those DVDs and

photographs, the evidence of P.W.2 as above will not

be sufficient.     The evidence of P.W.2 is absolutely

vague, because except deposing that he has received

said courier cover, he has not whispered anything

about sending of those materials by the accused.
 12                                                 C.C.No.3999/2011
15. In   oder   to      disprove       another     fact   that   the

photographs and the contents of the DVD do not

disclose the photo of the daughter of the complainant,

the learned counsel for accused has cross-examined

P.W.2 in detail.       In this regard P.W.2 has deposed in

para No.2, page No.7 to the following efect:

                After        perusal         of     the
          photographs           and    watching     the
          DVD      I    could    not    identify    the
          persons in the photographs and
          the DVD (the sheets containing
          photographs are already marked
          as Ex.P4). It is true to suggest that
          after watching the photographs
          and the contents of the DVD,
          myself,       my   wife      and   daughter
          Dakshayini got confrmed that the
          lady in the photographs and the
          DVD s not my daughter.
 13                                              C.C.No.3999/2011


     The unequivocal and categorical admission of

P.W.2 as above clearly establishes and proves beyond

reasonable doubt that the photographs and DVD

received by him were not at all            pertains to the

daughter of P.W.2.        When that being the case, the

allegations made against the accused that he has sent

vulgar   messages and obscene photos in the form of

DVD, is totally unsustainable and devoid of valid basis.



16. Similarly in further cross-examination, P.W.2 has

deposed in para No.3, page No.7 and 84 to the following

efect:

           It is true to suggest that there is no
         nay resemblance between the lady
         shown in the photographs and the
         DVD     compared     to    my   daughter
         Manjula. It is true to suggest that any
         third   person    who     has   seen     my
         daughter Manjula, if happen to see
         the photographs and the DVD, he will
 14                                            C.C.No.3999/2011


          say that the lady in them is not my
          daughter Manjula.
     The categorical admission of P.W.2 as above

further    clarifes   and     proves   that    the    alleged

photographs and contents of DVD are not at all

pertains to his daughter Manjula. Therefore, the

allegations made against the accused for the alleged

ofences are not at all proved.


17. Similarly P.W.2 has categorically deposed that he

did not take any action between 1-2-2010 to 6-2-2010

but fled complaint on 17-2-2010. There is a delay of

more than one month, which is not properly explained

by P.W.2. Therefore, the categorical admission of P.W.2

as above and non-explaining the delay in fling the

complaint, are all creates a doubt and I have no

hesitation to come to a conclusion that the complainant
 15                                            C.C.No.3999/2011


might have fled false and frivolous complaint just to

implicate the accused by making false allegations.



184. It is also important point to be noted at this stage

itself that with regard to sending of photographs and

DVD, P.W.2 has inquired with her daughter.             In this

regard P.W.2 has deposed in para No.1, page No.9 to

the following efect:

               I   did   not   consult   anybody
              except my elder daughter as to
              how the complaint has to be
              prepared.    When I inquired my
              daughter    Manjula   as   to     who
              might have sent the photographs
              and the DVD, she expressed her
              ignorance saying that she d not
              know who he might be.
     The evidence of P.W.2 as above further disproves

the allegations and creates a doubt with regard to

sending obscene messages to the daughter of P.W.2.
 16                                          C.C.No.3999/2011
19. It is also important point to be noted at this stage

itself that in further cross-examination in para No.2,

page No.10 and 11, P.W.2 has deposed to the following

efect:

               Now      I     see       complaint
            dt.17-2-2020.     It is a complaint
            fled   by   me     before     the     PI,
            Gnanabharathi Police Station, the
            saids document is marked              as
            Ex.D1. It is true to suggest that
            Ex.D1 bears my signature.           The
            signature of the witness is marked
            as Ex.D1(a).    It is true to suggest
            that along with Ex.D1, I have
            produced few documents.             It is
            true that in Ex.D1 it is mentioned
            that   my   daughter    has   deleted
            some of the e-mails from the Wipro
            e-mail ID box, which have come
            from
            [email protected].
 17                                               C.C.No.3999/2011


     The categorical admission of P.W.2 as above

further establishes that      earlier    P.W.2 has fled one

more complaint, which is at Ex.D1 and some of the

e-mails   have   been      deleted.     Therefore,    all   these

admission of P.W.2 creates a doubt with regard to

implication of accused by making false story, which

cannot be ruled out. It is also admitted by P.W.2 that

he has fled third complaint before the Commissioner of

Police on 15-3-2010.


20. In further cross-examination P.W.2 has deposed in

page No.12, para No.1 to the following efect:

                     It is true to suggest that
             after     I    ensured       that     the
             photographs are not belonging
             to my daughter I lost the fear in
             my mind.        Immediately after I
             received      the   cover,     I    gone
             through the photographs then I
             came     to      know       that    these
 18                                          C.C.No.3999/2011


                 photographs    are   not      the
                 photographs of my daughter.
     The unequivocal admission of P.W.2 as above

further disproves the case of the prosecution, because

the alleged photographs are not at all belongs to the

daughter of P.W.1. Therefore,         unequivocal        and

categorical admission of P.W.2 in the course of

cross-examination as above is not at all sufficient to

establish and prove the guilt of the accused for the

alleged ofences.


21. C.W.3 is examined as P.W.3. P.W.3 is none other

than another daughter of P.W.2 and elder sister of

P.W.1. In chief-examination P.W.3 has also deposed in

similar manner as deposed by her father P.W.2, with

regard to allegations made against the accused for the

alleged ofences. Therefore, I need not repeat the same

at this stage.
 19                                                          C.C.No.3999/2011
22. In order to disprove the case of the prosecution

and to test the veracity of P.W.3, the learned counsel

for accused has cross-examined P.W.3 in detail. In the

course of cross-examination, P.W.3 has deposed in

page No.5 and 6 to the following efect:

     The unequivocal admission of P.W.3 as above

clearly shows and proves that the alleged photo is not

at all belongs to her sister Manjula. The boy in the said

photo and video was not working in their office.                            As

already discussed above, the daughter of complainant

were close friends and partners of frm since long time.

Moreover, there is no material on record to establish

the existence of revenge on behalf of the accused and

the daughter of the complainant.

in page No.6 to the following efect:

      The unequivocal and categorical admission of

P.W.3 as above clearly establishes and proves beyond

reasonable doubt that whatever the photos produced

before the court are not at all belongs to the daughter

of P.W.2. When that being the case, the allegations

made against the accused that the accused has sent

vulgar messages and obscene photos of complainant 's

daughter is not at all proved.
 23                                                 C.C.No.3999/2011
24. In further cross-examination at page No.7, P.W.3

has deposed to the following efect:

     The evidence of P.W.3 as above is not at all

sufficient to establish and prove that the accused

himself has sent those specifc vulgar e-mails to the

daughter of P.W.2. Therefore, the evidence of P.W.3 is

not at all sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused for

the alleged ofences.


25. The victim C.W.2 is examined as P.W.4. P.W.4 has

deposed in chief-examination at length and reiterated

the allegations and contentions taken in the course of

complaint against the accused for the alleged ofences.
 24                                                      C.C.No.3999/2011


Hence, I need not repeat the same again at this stage.

To test the veracity of P.W.4, the learned counsel for

accused has cross-examined P.W.4 in detail. It is

deposed by P.W.4 that she came to know that her

father has received courier with DVD and photo on

31-1-2010 and went to Chennai on the next day from

where the alleged photos and DVDs alleged to have

been sent. In further chief-examination P.W.4 has

deposed with regard to receipt of e-mails on number of

occasions, but not given details of those e-mails and

also person from whom they had been sent.



26. In further cross-examination in page No.7, P.W.4

has deposed to the following efect:

     The ignorance pleaded by P.W.4 as above is not at

all sufficient to corroborate the allegations and not

sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused for the

alleged ofences.


27. In further cross-examination, P.W.4 has deposed at

page No. 84 to the following efect:

                     «rAiÉÆÃ ¹r ºÁUÀÆ ¥sÉÆÃmÉÆÃUÀ¼À

     The unequivocal and categorical admission of

P.W.4 as above clearly establishes that whatever the
 26                                                  C.C.No.3999/2011


alleged CD and photos received by P.W.2 are not at all

related to P.W.4. When that being the case, the

allegations made against the accused that he has sent

obscene photos and vulgar messages of P.W.4, is not at

sustainable.         Therefore,      the     inconsistent        and

uncorroborative evidence of P.W.4 is also not sufficient

to prove the guilt of the accused for the alleged

ofences.


284. C.W.5 is examined as P.W.5. P.W.5 is a Manager of

Blue Dart Courier, who has deposed with regard to

sending courier cover from Chennai to Bengaluru. In

this regard he has deposed to the following efect:

     The evidence of P.W.5 as above shows that one

cover was sent through courier from Chennai to

Bengaluru by one Ravi, but not Ramesh, who is the

accused in the present case. Therefore, this piece of

evidence of P.W.5 disproves the allegations made

against the accused that he has sent courier cover to

the complainant from Chennai.


29. C.W.4 is examined as P.W.6. P.W.6 was the

employee of Wipro Technologies, Chennai, who has

deposed that he was a colleague of accused and C.W.2

in the year 2010-2011. In chief-examination, P.W.6 has

deposed in page No.1 to the following efect:
 28                                                 C.C.No.3999/2011

     The evidence of P.W.6 as above discloses that

C.W.2 has shown one CD and photos received through

courier. As already discussed above in detail, the

evidence of P.Ws.2 to 4 proves that the alleged CD and

photos are not at all pertains to the victim               Manjula,

who is the daughter of the complainant. It is further

deposed by P.W.6 in further chief-examination that the

said e-mail was not at all sent by their company, that is

not relevant point to be noted at this stage, because

the contents of the sealed cover is important. When it

is proved that those contents are not depicts the photo

of Manjula, any amount of oral evidence of P.W.6 is not
 29                                                    C.C.No.3999/2011


sufficient to corroborate and to prove the guilt of the

accused.


30. In cross-examination at page No.3, P.W.6 has

deposed to the following efect:

     The clear evidence of P.W.6 as above further

disproves the allegations made against the accused

that the accused has sent obscene messages and

photos of Manjula to P.W.2 to Bengaluru address.

31. C.W.7 is examined as P.W.7. P.W.7 has deposed

with regard to uploading of e-mail messages alleged to

be sent by the accused to Manjula to the following

efect:

               ನಮಗ    ಶರತ‍ ಅವರರ        ಈ   ಪ ಪಕರಣದ

     The evidence of P.W.7 is not corroborative and

consistent, because the evidence of P.W.7 as above is

hear say evidence.     The evidence of P.W.7 is not

pertains to the disputed C.D.


32. In further cross-examination, P.W.7 has deposed

in page No.2 to the following efect:
 31                                              C.C.No.3999/2011

                ನ ವ ಹಸರನಲ ಇತರತ.
        ಮನಜರಳ ಎನರ



     The evidence of P.W.7 as above quite contrary to

the evidence adduced by P.Ws.2 to 4, because when

P.Ws.2 to 4 have deposed that the alleged photos and

videos are not related to Manjula, how P.W.7 has

deposed that they are related to her.           Therefore, the

evidence of P.W.7 is nothing but improvement made

after the evidence of P.Ws.1 to 4, just to over come the

anomaly occurred in the evidence of P.Ws.1 to 4.



33. The       learned       counsel     for    accused       has

cross-examined P.W.7 in brief. To disprove the seizure

of disputed laptop, in cross-examination P.W.7 has

deposed in para No.2, page No.4 to the following efect:

      The evidence of P.W.4 as above is not at all

sufficient to prove the seizure of M.O.3. When the

evidence of P.W.7 is not sufficient to prove the seizure,

the chance of manipulation cannot be ruled out.



34. C.W.6 is      examined as P.W.84.          P.W.84 is another

independent witness, who has also deposed in similar

manner as deposed by P.W.7 with regard to dispute.
 33                                                     C.C.No.3999/2011


Similarly P.W.84 has further deposed in page No.2 to the

following efect:

     The evidence of P.W.84 as above is absolutely

vague, because he has not whispered anything about

whether those e-mails were sent by the accused or not.



35. The      learned        counsel            for     accused      has

cross-examined P.W.84 in detail. In the course of

     The evidence of P.W.84 as above shows that

     The   evidence      of    P.W.84       as   above     further

establishes that the mail found as per Ex.P14(b) and (c)

are printouts taken from in box, but not sent items.

Therefore, this piece of evidence is also not sufficient

to prove that the accused himself has sent those

e-mails to P.W.2.


37. In further cross-examination, P.W.84 has deposed

in para No.2, page No.5 to the following efect:
 36                                                  C.C.No.3999/2011

      The evidence of P.W.84 as above further disproves

the   allegations   made         against     the    accused     that

whatever the printouts taken from the concerned

web sites are not at all sufficient to prove the

allegations made against the accused.



384. It is further deposed by P.W.84 in page No.6 to the

following efect:
 37                                                      C.C.No.3999/2011

     The categorical admission of P.W.84 as above

proves that whatever the download made to CD are all

from Google website, but not from the account of the

daughter of the complainant.


39. C.W.84 is examined as P.W.9. P.W.9 is another

seizure mahazar, who has not supported the case of

the prosecution with regard to dispute. Therefore, he

was treated as hostile witness and cross-examined by

the learned Senior APP with the permission of the

court. But in the course of cross-examination, nothing

worth has been elicited to prove the mahazar.
 38                                                     C.C.No.3999/2011
40. C.W.10 is examined as P.W.10. P.W.10 is the

owner of house which was let out to accused and his

friend Hemanthkumar, Jenifer on monthly rent of

Rs.4,000/-. The evidence of P.W.10 is not sufficient to

prove the allegations except to establish that the

accused was residing in a rented house.



41. C.W.12 is examined as P.W.11. P.W.11 is the

independent witness, who has deposed to the following

efect:

     The evidence of P.W.11 is absolutely vague and

he has not whispered anything about sending those

obscene photos and messages by the accused. In

cross-examination,          P.W.11        has   deposed         that       the

Investigating Officer has shown the print outs taken by

him and obtained his signature.


42. C.W.13 is examined as P.W.12. P.W.12 is a Nodal

Officer of Bharati Airtel company. It is deposed by him

that as requested by the Investigating Officer he has

furnished         CIF      details        pertains         to        mobile

No.99029623006 and also furnished the print outs of

call   details,     which      is    at   Exs.P21       and         P22.    In

cross-examination, P.W.12 has deposed to the following

efect:

     The    evidence        of   P.W.12       as        above      further

establishes that he has not produced any certifcate for

having supplied the call details of mobile. Therefore,

the evidence of P.W.12 cannot be considered, because

the provisions contemplated under Section 65(B) of

Indian Evidence Act are not complied with.                          Mere

supply of call details and print outs, is not sufficient to

prove that the accused himself has sent those mails to

the complainant.


43. C.W.15 is examined as P.W.13. P.W.13 is one of

the partners of Web Channel in which the accused is

also one of the partner. The evidence of P.W.13 is not

sufficient to prove the guilt except to establish that the
 41                                                      C.C.No.3999/2011


accused is one of the partners of the said Web channel,

which is not in dispute.


44. C.W.11 is examined as P.W.14.                         P.W.14 has

deposed in chief-examination to the following efect:

     The evidence of P.W.14 as above is vague and he

has not whispered anything about sending obscene

messages and photos by the accused, but he has

deposed     that     somebody         has    sent       those     vulgar

messages.
 42                                                     C.C.No.3999/2011

     The evidence of P.W.14 further establishes that

the daughter of the complainant Manjula herself

brought P.W.14 to place of incident, but not by the

Investigating officer.


46. In further cross-examination in page No.4, P.W.14

has deposed to the following efect:
 43                                                    C.C.No.3999/2011

      The evidence of P.W.14 is not corroborative to

prove the print outs as per Ex.P19 that the accused has

sent those messages.


47. C.W.19 is examined as P.W.15. P.W.15 is a

employee of yahoo.com Private Limited, who has

deposed with regard to furnishing of e-mail details to

the   Investigating       officer   and       got    marked      those

documents as Exs.P25 to P30.             The learned counsel for

accused has cross-examined P.W.15 in detail.                    In the

course of cross-examination in page No.2 and 3, P.W.15

has deposed to the following efect:

     The categorical admission of P.W.15 as above

clearly establishes that they have no facility to have

access to e-mails send through yahoo.com. When that

being the case, whatever the information given by him

as per Ex.P25 to P30 have no evidential value.

     The categorical admission P.W.15 as above clearly

establishes that whatever the e-mails sent through

website will be retained only for the period of 90 days
 46                                                  C.C.No.3999/2011


and thereafter those details will be deleted. Therefore,

having regard to the date of e-mails and printouts

taken in respect of alleged e-mails clearly shows that

by the time printout were taken 90 days period was

elapsed. Hence, whatever the details furnished are not

at all relevant and not pertains to the accused.



49. In further cross-examination, P.W.15 has deposed

in page No.4 to the following efect:

     The   admission   of   P.W.15   as   above    further

establishes and proves that the contents of CD, which

is at M.O.4 are not proved. Hence, the evidence of

P.W.15 also not sufficient to prove the allegations made

against the accused.


50. C.W.20 is examined as P.W.16. P.W.16 is a

Forensic Lab scientist, who has deposed in chief-

examination that they have received sealed covers,

which are marked as Exs.P1 to P10 from Cyber Crime

Police, Bengaluru for investigation.       It is further

deposed by P.W.6 that after scientifc investigation he

has received one laptop, one hard disc and he has

examined these materials along with one M.Krishna

and submitted detailed report consisting of 41 pages,

which is marked as Ex.P31. The evidence of P.W.16 as

above shows that P.W.16 with the assistance of his

colleague M.Krishna he has examined those materials.
 48                                          C.C.No.3999/2011


Accordingly P.W.16 and M.Krishna have signed the

report jointly. The perusal of records reveals that said

M.Krishna who is another scientist submitted joint

report is not examined in the present case. Therefore,

examination    of   P.W.16   alone    without    examining

another Scientist M.Krishna is not sufficient to prove

the joint report submitted by two Scientists. It is further

deposed by P.W.16 that he has submitted another

additional report containing 9 pages along with his

colleague Sai Prasad, which is marked as Ex.P41.

Similarly the examination of P.W.16 alone without

examining Sai Prasad is not sufficient to prove the joint

report submitted by two Scientists.


51. In order to test the veracity of P.W.16 and in order

to disprove the joint report submitted by P.W.16, the

learned   counsel   for   accused    has   cross-examined

P.W.16 in detail.   In the course of cross-examination,
 49                                              C.C.No.3999/2011


P.W.16 has deposed in page No.84 to the following

efect:

           ನನನ ಸದರ ವರದಯಲ ಸದರ ಹರರ‍ ಡಸಕ‍ ನಲ

         ಡಟಗಳರ         ಯವ    ರಮತ       ಬನದರರತತವನದರ

         ಕದಡ ನಮದದರ ಮಡಲಶವನದರ ಸರ.
     The categorical admission of P.W.16 as above

clearly establishes that he has not mentioned how the

disputed datas were created in the said hard disc.

Similarly he has not whispered anything about the

source of those disputed fles. Unless that is proved,

the allegations made against the accused that he has

uploaded the videos in the internet is not proved.



52. In further cross-examination it is deposed by

P.W.16    that   the   Investigating     officer   has    made
 50                                        C.C.No.3999/2011


requisition on 184-6-2011 requesting him to give opinion

with regard to name of the person, in whose name the

operating system and user name were written. Except

this, there is no requisition by the Investigating Officer

to give any other opinion. Unless and until the fact of

uploading and sending vulgar messages from the

operating system is proved, the vague allegations

made against the accused that he has done the said

illegal act is not sustainable.


53. In further cross-examination, P.W.16 has deposed

in page No.6 and 7 to the following efect:

 51                                        C.C.No.3999/2011
     The categorical admission of P.W.16 as above

clearly establishes that the disputed system was shut

down on 12-3-2010 and it was not opened thereafter.

When that being the case, the allegations made

against the accused that he has uploaded and sent

vulgar messages and photos to the victim by using

alleged computer is not sustainable and devoid of valid

basis.


54. Similarly,     in    the   course      of      further

cross-examination, P.W.16 has deposed to the following

efect:

                 ಯವದಮ ಒನದರ ಸಸಸಮ‍ ನರ
                                  ನ ಶಟರನ‍

     The unequivocal admission of P.W.16 as above

further proves that the disputed computer system was

not at all used subsequent to 12-3-2010. When that

being the case, the allegations made against the

accused with regard to commission of alleged ofences

by using shut down system is not sustainable. Hence,

the inconsistent and categorical admission of P.W.16

creates a doubt with regard to the allegations made

against the accused for commission of alleged ofences

by using electronic equipments.


55. C.W.12 is examined as P.W.17. P.W.17 is a Legal

Manager of Google India. In chief-examination, P.W.17

has deposed to the following efect:
 53                                      C.C.No.3999/2011

     The evidence of P.W.17 as above will not help the

prosecution in any way to prove its case for the ofence

made against the accused.


56. C.W.16 is examined as P.W.184.        P.W.184 has

deposed with regard to registration of a complaint fled

by the complainant and seizer of CD, photos and other

documents under the mahazar. Mere registration of a

complaint and conducting seizure mahazar, will not be
 54                                        C.C.No.3999/2011


sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused that he has

committed the alleged ofences.


57. In the course of cross-examination, P.W.184 has

deposed that after instructions given by the Technician,

he has conducted the mahazar by opening laptop.

P.W.184 is not a Technician.       In cross-examination

P.W.184 has deposed in page No.2 and 3 to the follow

efect:

           Q: At the time of investigation you
         have noticed that the flm was already in
         internet. What do you say?
           Ans: The accused has disclosed that
         the said flm was already in internet.
     The categorical admission of P.W.84 as above

clearly shows that disputed videos were already in the

internet before seizing or taking copies of the videos in

the CD help the prosecution to prove the guilt, because
 55                                      C.C.No.3999/2011


this piece of evidence of P.W.184 is not sufficient to

establish that the accused himself has uploaded

abusive photos and messages.


584. C.W.17 is examined as P.W.19. In order to prove

the guilt of the accused for the alleged ofences, the

evidence of P.W.19 is very important. P.W.19 is the

Investigating officer, who has deposed with regard to

investigation conducted by him during investigation. It

is further deposed by P.W.19 that he has collected

certain   information   from   the   concerned    Yahoo

Company with regard to details of IP address and

physical address and details of all the disputed phone

numbers. It is further deposed by P.W.19 that with the

help of Technician, he has opened laptops to get

details of e-mails alleged to be sent by the accused to

the victim. It is further deposed by him that he has

instructed the Technician to download the video found
 56                                          C.C.No.3999/2011


in the website alleged to be sent by the accused. But in

chief-examination itself P.W.19 has deposed in page

No.3 to the following efect:


          After login I found the status of
          e-mail ID deactivated.
      The evidence of P.W.19 as above clearly shows

that the status of the e-mail ID was deactivated.

Similarly it is also pertinent to note that P.W.19 has not

whispered anything, when exactly and             at whose

instance the status of e-mail ID was deactivated and he

has further deposed that he has recorded the voluntary

statement of the accused. Mere recording of voluntary

statement of the accused will not help the prosecution,

because it is not admissible in evidence.



59. It is further deposed by him that as per Ex.P47 the

accused     has     sent       secondary      e-mail       ID
 57                                          C.C.No.3999/2011
[email protected] i.e., mail from which

the victim has received the obscene videos and

messages. This piece of evidence of P.W.19 will not be

sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused, as the

accused himself has sent those obscene videos and

messages to the victims through the above said e-mail.

Similarly in further cross-examination he has secured

certain    opinion   with   regard   to   CIF   of   mobile

No.9902963006, the CIF is marked as Ex.P20 and call

detail register is marked as Ex.P21.


60. In further chief-examination itself P.W.19 has

deposed that the said mobile number was used at

Chennai.    It is further deposed by him that as per

Ex.P20 the accused is the owner of th said mobile

number.     Mere establishment of fact that the above

said mobile number is belongs to the accused, it does
 58                                         C.C.No.3999/2011


not mean that he has sent vulgar messages to the

victim by using said mobile.


61. To disprove the case of the prosecution, the

learned   counsel   for   accused   has   cross-examined

P.W.19 in detail. In the    course of cross-examination

P.W.19 has categorically admitted that on the basis of

IP address and phone number he has made the

accused person as an accused in the present case. It is

also admitted by P.W.19 that the laptop which was

seized from the office premises namely weblabs and

pixo labs and web echelon, which are all belongs to the

same company.       The said company is a partnership

frm in which Jenifer, Ramesh, Hemanthkumar and

D'souza   are   working.    Therefore,    the   categorical

admission of P.W.19 as above further establishes that

disputed laptop and CD were seized from the office of

the company, but not from the possession of the
 59                                              C.C.No.3999/2011


accused. It is also important point to be noted at this

stage itself that as admitted by P.W.19 as above it is

clear that all the partners of the company had access

to the above said electronic computers. Therefore, it I

very difficult to pin point to any particular person, with

regard to use of those computer.


62.     In further cross-examination it is admitted by

P.W.19 that as per Ex.P49 the telephone is standing in

the name of Webechelon company. To              the     question

posed    by   the   learned    counsel    for   accused      that

Webechelon      company       did   not   have        any   other

connection except for business purpose, P.W.19 has

deposed that he has investigated with regard to IP

address. Therefore, this vague evidence of P.W.19 is

not sufficient to prove that the accused alone had

access to Webechelon.com and used the same to

commit the alleged ofences.
 60                                            C.C.No.3999/2011
63. In further cross-examination it is admitted that the

seized laptops were laying on the table in the premises

of Webechelon company but other partners of the frm

had access the said laptop.         Hence, the allegations

made against the accused that he has used the said

laptops   to   commit      the   alleged   ofences,      is   not

sustainable and devoid of valid basis. In further

cross-examination with regard to access of laptop there

is question and answer in page No.10 to the following

efect:

           Q:- Whether we have investigated the
          fact, whether the particular premises
          of the company was used by the
          accused herein exclusively or by other
          partners and employees?
          Ans:-   Since,   the   said   premises    is
          belongs to the company who were
          working in the said company are using
          that premises.
 61                                             C.C.No.3999/2011
     The categorical admission of P.W.19 as above is

not supportive to prove the fact that the accused

himself alone had exclusive use of the said computer

and laptop to send obscene messages and abusive

photographs.


64. In   further   cross-examination      in    page    No.10,

P.W.19 has deposed to the following efect:

               As per my investigation and
          after thorough verifcation of the
          material seized, I came to know
          that the particular laptop i.e.,
          M.O.3    was   used   for    sending
          obscene messages, creating and
          publishing     obscene      materials
          and it is seized under Ex.P1.
     The evidence of P.W.19 as above is not at all

sufficient to prove that the accused has used the said

laptop to sent obscene materials to the victim as
 62                                        C.C.No.3999/2011


alleged in the complaint. In fact it is admitted that the

expert has examined the entire laptop including the

indicators and it is admitted by P.W.19 that the drive

'C' as per Ex.P31 is blank and drive 'D' named as

Webechelon and drive 'F' as back up.


65. It is further deposed by P.W.19 in page No.11 to

the following efect:

               Q:- In the report submitted by
           the FSL the name of the accused is
           not disclosed, either in any fle or
           folder?
           Ans:- The computer name itself
           shown name of the accused          as
           Ramesh.



     The inconsistent evidence of P.W.19 as above

further creates a doubt . As already discussed above,

absolutely there is no evidence on record to prove the
 63                                       C.C.No.3999/2011


fact that the accused alone had access to use the

computers and laptops to commit the alleged ofences.

66. It is further deposed by P.W.19 in page No.11 to

the following efect:

                It is true to suggest that, as
            per ExP31 to 35 subject videos
            and photographs of the present
            case   are found in drive D.
     The unequivocal and categorical admission of

P.W.19 as above clearly establishes that videos and

photographs, which are at Ex.P31 to P35 are found in

drive 'D' which is in the name of webechelon, but not in

the name of accused. Therefore, the unequivocal

admission of P.W.19 as above is not sufficient to prove

the allegations made against the accused.
  64                                            C.C.No.3999/2011
67. In further cross-examination P.W.19 has deposed

in page No.12 to the following efect:

            It is true to suggest that, in ExP32
       there is no mention about the me of the
       accused in drive or folder of the lap top.
       Witness   voluntaries that so       for      as
       present case is concerned there are lot
       of   personal       photographs   and     other
       materials in this laptop.
       When there are lot of personal photographs and

other materials in the laptop, the evidence of P.W.19

that the accused had sent abusive messages and

photographs to the victim leads to doubt.



684.   further cross-examination in page No.12, P.W.19

has deposed to the following efect:

            I   am   not    aware    whether      the
         contents shown in the ExP32 were
         uploaded on or before 16.10.2009. It is
         true to suggest that, the alleged video
 65                                        C.C.No.3999/2011


       were uploaded to the website on or
       before 16.10.2009.


      The admission of P.W.19 as above further proves

that he is not in a position to depose when exactly the

abusive videos are uploaded to the victim.      It is also

very important point to be noted at this stage itself that

any amount of oral evidence of P.W.19 with regard to

investigation will not be sufficient to prove the guilt of

the accused, because the complainant i.e., P.W.2 and

his two daughters P.Ws.3 and 4 have categorically and

unequivocally admitted that whatever the photos and

videos uploaded and sent, are not at all belongs to

P.W.4. Therefore, the allegations made against the

accused that he has downloaded abusive photos from

internet and edited, renamed and republished the

same in the internet is totally unsustainable and devoid

of valid basis.   Therefore, whatever the allegations
 66                                      C.C.No.3999/2011


made against the accused for commission of alleged

ofences cannot be countenanced for any reasons.



69. C.W.22 is examined as P.W.20. P.W.20 is a

Technical Assistant in CID office, who has deposed with

regard to accompanying the Investigating officer to

Webechelon and seized certain computers and CD by

opening e-mail ID under mahazar. In    the   course    of

cross-examination, P.W.20 has deposed in page No.3 to

the following efect:

               ಮಹಜರ ನಲ ಇರರವ ವಷಯ ಗದತರತ

            ಆರದಮಪಯರ     ಯವ        ಕನಪಕಟರ     ನರ
                                              ನ

            ಉಪಯಗಸರತತದದರರ      ಎನದರ    ತನಖಧಕರ

            ಆರದಮಪಯನರ
                   ನ     ಕಮಳದರರ   ಎನಬರದರ     ಬಗಲ

            ಮಹಜರ ಪನಚನಮಯಲ ಬರದಲಶವನದರ ಸರ.
     The categorical admission of P.W.20 as above is

not sufficient to establish that whatever the photos
 67                                        C.C.No.3999/2011


alleged to be sent and downloaded by P.W.20 is not in

the presence or assistance of the accused. As already

discussed above in view of the submission made not

only the accused, but other partners of the frm had

access to the computer devices.      Hence, there is no

prima facie evidence to establish and prove that the

accused himself has sent the abusive messages and

videos to the victim.


70. C.W.23 is examined as P.W.21. P.W.21 is another

Technical Expert, who has deposed that he has given

mirror image data which was seized by the police and

stored in a system and seized under the mahazar.

When the evidence of P.Ws.19 and 20 is not sufficient

to prove the commission of ofences, the seizure of

objects will not be helpful to       the case of the

prosecution. At the cost of repetition it is pertinent to

note that the evidence of P.W.19 is not sufficient to
 68                                         C.C.No.3999/2011


prove the seizure of articles from the accused and

there is no evidence    to prove that the accused has

used those articles to commit the alleged ofences.



71. It is also pertinent to note that C.W.22                  is

examined as P.W.20 was not mentioned in the charge

sheet as charge sheet witnesses, but he was examined

on behalf of prosecution, on the application fled by the

prosecution   subsequently.    Similarly   there    is   no

evidence on record to prove that the seized laptop is

exclusively belongs to the accused and he alone used

it. It is also pertinent to note that as per Ex.P32, there

are four drives in the system, but there is no evidence

on record to prove that all four drives were used by the

accused. It is also important point to be noted at this

stage that there are some videos in the 'D' drive, but

there is no evidence to prove the fact that the said

video has link with the accused.      Therefore, viewed
 69                                        C.C.No.3999/2011


from any angle and in view of the evidence adduced by

the prosecution, both oral and documentary, is not at

all sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused for the
