                          Sri Kaushal Kumar Jha, learned Senior Advocate

          has requested for exempting the personal appearance of the

          R.B.I. officials who are appearing virtually pursuant to the

          direction of this Court.

                          In the opinion of this Court, this is a very important

          matter and this cyber crime is to be controlled not only by the

          law enforcement agencies but also by the regulations made by

          the R.B.I. to protect the bank accounts of the individuals and

          therefore, their personal appearance in virtual mode is

          necessary. Hence, the prayer of Sri Kaushal Kumar Jha, learned

          Senior Advocate, for exempting the appearance of R.B.I.

          officials is rejected for the present and the officials of the R.B.I.

          are directed to appear on the next date of hearing i.e. on

          07.02.2022.

                         Violation of TRAI guidelines by the
                         Telecom Companies.

                          Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned Senior Advocate

          appears in Interlocutory application filed by the Cellular

          Operators Association of India for being added as party

          respondent in the present proceeding. He submits that he will

          make his arguments on this Interlocutory Application on a

          subsequent date.

                          The Court has no objection in accepting the prayer

          of Sri Mukul Rohatgi, learned Senior Advocate. Accordingly,

          Interlocutory Application filed by the Cellular Operators

          Association of India is adjourned.

                          In the order dated 11.01.2022, this Court had made

          following observations, which are reproduced herein-below:-

                                  "It appears that Telecom companies are prima
                          facie violating the guidelines of the TRAI and they are
                          not registering F.I.R. with regard to the fraud
                          committed by using their SIM and they have come up
                          with a novel way of filing complaint in the office of the
                          D.G.P. and getting an acknowledgment of the same and
                          as per them this is the procedure followed by the
                          Telecom companies.
                                  Telecom companies are acting under the license
                          granted by the Government and they cannot try to
                          outreach the terms of the license.
                                  In these circumstances, the Circle Heads of
                          Bihar of all Telecom Companies i.e. Bharti Airtel,
                          Vodafone Idea, B.S.N.L. and Reliance JIO Limited are
                          directed to join the proceeding virtually on the date
                          fixed i.e. 13.01.2022 and they should also file an
                          affidavit as to how they are abiding the guidelines of
                          the TRAI."
                          Clause - 10 of Circular dated 09.08.2012 requires

          that the service provider is to lodge F.I.R. in the concerned

          Police Station or complaint in the competent Court if any forged

          document is found with CAF (Customer Application Form). It

          would be useful to quote Clause-10 of the Circular dated

          09.08.2012 issued by the TRAI, which is as follows:-

                          "10. Lodging Complaint / FIR:

                       (i) TERM Cell shall indicate the apparently forged cases
                          as per their observations in the CAF Audit giving
                          reasons for prima facie observation to the Licensee
                          and marking them as a failed case for CAF Audit. The
                          Licensee shall investigate such cases at their level and
                          take necessary action as detailed below.

                       (ii) In order to deal with the use of forged documents for
                          obtaining mobile connections, complaint/FIR may be
                          lodged with the law enforcement agencies under the
                          law of land. The complainant should clearly mention
                          the information about the mobile umber, type of
                          document forged along with the details about the
                          issuing authority, date of issue, reason for suspicion as
                          forged document, name of the person suspected (e.g.
                          name of subscriber/PoS/Franchiesse/Licensee).

                      (iii) In cases where forged documents are submitted by the
                          subscriber and originals are also forged, Police
                          complaint/F.I.R. shall be lodged by the PoS/Franchisee
                          against the subscriber within fifteen days of bringing it
                          to the notice of the Licensee.

                       (iv) In case PoS/Franchisee fails to lodge complaint/FIR
                          as above, Licensee shall lodge FIR/Complaint against
                          the subscriber and Franchisee/PoS within further three
                          days.
                       (v) In case where it is found that the forgery has been
                          done by point of sale, the Licensee shall lodge the

                          complaint/FIR against the Franchisee/point of sale
                          within one week and financial penalty shall be
                          imposed.

                       (vi) In case no action is taken by the Licensee as above or
                          the Licensee itself is involved in forgery, TERM Cell
                          shall lodge Complaint/FIR against Licensee. Penalty
                          shall be imposed on all such forged cases also.

                       (vii) In cases where it is found that the act of issuing
                          connections were done by point of sale using the
                          document of some other subscriber or any person
                          without the knowledge of the subscriber or the person,
                          or the documents were forged by the franchisee/PoS of
                          Licensee, the concerned PoS / franchisee may be
                          terminated by the Licensee under intimation to the
                          Licensor      (concerned TERM cell of DoT) and the
                          designated security agencies, in addition to the actions
                          mentioned above. The same may be intimated to all
                          other Licensee (s) in that Service Area by TERM Cell.
                          The other Licensees after getting any such intimation
                          shall terminate / not appoint any such point of sale.

                       (viii) No penalty shall be imposed on the Licensee, if the
                          laid down process of activation / verification
                          applicable at the time of activation has been followed
                          and the forgery is done by subscriber. In case where
                          activation/verification process is not followed by the
                          Licensee, the penalty shall be imposed even if the
                          documents are found to be forged."

                          Cyber crimes begin with the sale of SIMs to cyber

          criminals on the basis of forged documents. Once this forgery is

          committed, the cyber criminals, who use the SIM by obtaining
 Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.38807 of 2020(15) dt.01-02-2022
                                           16/29




          the same on the basis of forged documents, cannot be traced

          and it is the public at large who has to suffer. The guideline

          particularly for registration of the F.I.R./complaint by the

          Telecom Companies is not merely a procedure to be followed by

          them but once the F.I.R./complaint is filed by a particular person

          with regard to a particular crime, the Police will be activated

          and persons using the SIMs on the basis of forged and fabricated

          documents can be traced and arrested. If no F.I.R. is registered

          on the complaints made by the Telecom Companies then the

          cyber criminals operating in the State can never be traced and

          arrested. The Telecom Companies cannot be allowed to operate

          in complete violation of the guidelines of the Department of

          Telecommunications (DoT). It seems that neither the D.G.P. nor

          the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has acted when

          the guidelines of the Department of Telecommunications were

          being violated with impunity. However, the Telecom Companies

          have found a novel way of not filing F.I.R. but by filing written

          complaints in the D.G.P. office and taking acknowledgment of

          the same. In the opinion of this Court, since the officers of the

          Department of Telecommunications posted in Bihar for last

          many years have accepted this practice, they are also

          responsible for violation of their own circular. This Court had

                                           17/29




          already directed the Telecom Companies to act as per the

          aforesaid circular dated 09.08.2012 and file complaint/F.I.R.

          before the competent Court/ concerned Police Stations and not

          in any other manner.

                          In the above circumstances, the Director General of

          Police, Bihar, is directed to file an affidavit within a period of

          two weeks from today as to what actions were taken on the

          complaints made by the Telecom Companies in his office.

                          The Department of Telecommunications is also to

          explain as to why it allowed the violation of the guidelines and

          allowed the Telecom Companies to operate without registration

          of the F.I.R./complaint as provided under the guidelines.

                          The Telecom Companies are also to explain as to

          why they have adopted this method of filing complaints in the

          office of the Director General of Police as the same is neither a

          complaint nor an F.I.R. under the Cr.P.C. The Telecom

          Companies should also show cause as to why PENALTY should

          not be levied upon them for violation of the guidelines of the

          Department of Telecommunications since the very beginning,

          which has resulted in spurt in cases of cyber crimes, which has

          made the State of Bihar and particularly the districts of Nawada,

          Nalanda and Sheikhpura in famous in the entire country as

                                            18/29




          everyday some Police team from other parts of the country are

          visiting the State of Bihar to arrest the cyber criminals. The

          Telecom Companies cannot be allowed to act in such a manner

          which has resulted in giving bad name to Bihar.

                          Today,      Mr.     Mukul      Rohatgi,   learned   Senior

          Advocate, submits that the Telecom Companies will face

          difficulty if they are asked to file F.I.Rs in the various Police

          Stations under whose jurisdiction the crimes have been

          committed and therefore, the Telecom Companies be allowed to

          file complaints before the Superintendents of Police of the

          concerned districts in which the crime was committed. In

          support of his submissions, he has relied upon a judgment of

          Madras High Court rendered in the case of Seethalakshmi vs.

          State of Tamil Nadu and Ors. reported in 1989 SCC Online

          Mad 272 : 1991 Cri LJ 1037, more particularly paragraph no.

          19 onward of the judgment and submitted that under law an

          F.I.R. can be filed under Section 36 of the Code of Criminal

          Procedure (for short "Cr.P.C.") before the Superintendent of

          Police of the concerned district.

                          I have considered the submissions of Sri Mukul

          Rohatgi, learned Senior Advocate and gone through the

          aforesaid judgment of the Madras High Court.

                          Chapter-XII of the Cr.P.C. deals with information

          to the Police and their powers to investigate. For proper

          appreciation of the facts, it would be relevant to quote Sections

          154 to 160 of the Cr.P.C. which read as under:-

                          the power to arrest without warrant) as an officer in
                          charge of a police station may exercise in a cognizable
                          case.

                          which at least one is cognizable, the case shall be
                          deemed to be a cognizable case, notwithstanding that
                          the other offences are non-cognizable.

                          the local area within the limits of such station would
                          have power to inquire into or try under the provisions
                          of Chapter XIII.

                          shall at any stage be called in question on the ground

                          information received or otherwise, an officer in charge
                          of a police station has reason to suspect the
                          commission of an offence which he is empowered under
                          section 156 to investigate, he shall forthwith send a

                          and, if necessary, to take measures for the discovery
                          and arrest of the offender:

                          case is not of a serious nature, the officer in charge of a
                          police station need not proceed in person or depute a
                          subordinate officer to make an investigation on the
                          spot;
                          (b) if it appears to the officer in charge of a police
                          station that there is no sufficient ground for entering on
                          an investigation, he shall not investigate the case.
                                  [Provided further that in relation to an offence
                          of rape, the recording of statement of the victim shall
                          be conducted at the residence of the victim or in the

                          that he will not investigate the case or cause it to be
                          investigated.
                          158. Report how submitted.-- (1)Every report sent to a
                          Magistrate under section 157 shall, if the State

                          inquiry.-- Such Magistrate, on receiving such report,
                          may direct an investigation, or, if he thinks fit, at once

                          provided in this Code.
                          160. Police officer's power to require attendance of
                          witnesses.--       (1)Any     police   officer   making   an
                          investigation under this Chapter may, by order in

                           "36. Powers of superior officers of police.--Police
                           officers superior in rank to an officer in charge of a

                           throughout the local area to which they are appointed,
                           as may be exercised by such officer within the limits of
                           his station."
                          The Supreme Court in the case of Priyanka

          Srivastava & Another vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors.

          reported in (2015) 6 SCC 287 while dealing with the power of

          the Magistrate to be exercised under Section 156(3) of the

          Cr.P.C., has held that there has to be prior applications under

          Section 154 (1) and 154 (3) while filing a petition under Section
 Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.38807 of 2020(15) dt.01-02-2022
                                           25/29




          156 (3) of the Cr.P.C.

                          The Supreme Court in the case of Lalita Kumari

          vs. State of U.P. reported in (2014) 2 SCC 1 has issued the

          following guidelines for registration of the F.I.R.

                     120. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we hold:
                    120.1. Registration of FIR is mandatory under Section 154
                         of the Code, if the information discloses commission of
                         a cognizable offence and no preliminary inquiry is
                         permissible in such a situation.
                    120.2. If the information received does not disclose a
                         cognizable offence but indicates the necessity for an
                         inquiry, a preliminary inquiry may be conducted only
                         to ascertain whether cognizable offence is disclosed or
                         not.
                     120.3. If the inquiry discloses the commission of a
                         cognizable offence, the FIR must be registered. In
                         cases where preliminary inquiry ends in closing the
                         complaint, a copy of the entry of such closure must be
                         supplied to the first informant forthwith and not later
                         than one week. It must disclose reasons in brief for
                         closing the complaint and not proceeding further.
                     120.4. The police officer cannot avoid his duty of
                         registering offence if cognizable offence is disclosed.
                         Action must be taken against erring officers who do not
                         register the FIR if information received by him
                         discloses a cognizable offence.
                      120.5. The scope of preliminary inquiry is not to verify the
                         veracity or otherwise of the information received but
                         only to ascertain whether the information reveals any
                         cognizable offence.
                    120.6. As to what type and in which cases preliminary
                         inquiry is to be conducted will depend on the facts and
                         circumstances of each case. The category of cases in
                         which preliminary inquiry may be made are as under:
 Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.38807 of 2020(15) dt.01-02-2022
                                           26/29
                          a) Matrimonial disputes/ family disputes
                          b) Commercial offences
                          c) Medical negligence cases
                          d) Corruption cases
                          (e) Cases where there is abnormal delay/laches in
                          initiating criminal prosecution, for example, over 3
                          months delay in reporting the matter without
                          satisfactorily explaining the reasons for delay.
                                 The aforesaid are only illustrations and not
                          exhaustive of all conditions which may warrant
                          preliminary inquiry.
                    102.7. While ensuring and protecting the rights of the
                         accused and the complainant, a preliminary inquiry
                         should be made time bound and in any case it should
                         not exceed 7 days. The fact of such delay and the
                         causes of it must be reflected in the General Diary
                         entry.
                    102.8. Since the General Diary/Station Diary/Daily Diary is
                         the record of all information received in a police
                         station, we direct that all information relating to
                         cognizable offences, whether resulting in registration
                         of FIR or leading to an inquiry, must be mandatorily
                         and meticulously reflected in the said Diary and the
                         decision to conduct a preliminary inquiry must also be
                         reflected, as mentioned above."


                          The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sakiri

          Vasu vs. State of U.P. & Ors. reported in 2008 (2) SCC 409 has

          observed in paragraph no.25 as under:-

                    "25. We have elaborated on the above matter because we
                          often find that when someone has a grievance that his
                          FIR has not been registered at the police station and/or
                          a proper investigation is not being done by the police,
                          he rushes to the High Court to file a writ petition or a

                                           27/29




                          petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. We are of the
                          opinion that the High Court should not encourage this
                          practice and should ordinarily refuse to interfere in
                          such matters, and relegate the petitioner to his
                          alternating remedy, firstly under Section 154(3) and
                          Section 36 Cr.P.C. before the concerned police officers,
                          and if that is of no avail, by approaching the concerned
                          Magistrate under Section 156(3)."
                          From reading of the decisions i.e. Priyanka

          Srivastava (supra) Lalita Kumari (supra) and Sakiri Vasu

          (supra) and also the relevant provisions of the Cr.P.C., it is clear

          that registration of F.I.R. is provided under Chapter-XII of the

          Cr.P.C. and not under Section 36 of the Cr.P.C. In the opinion of

          this Court Section 36 of the Cr.P.C. comes into play only when

          no action is taken by the concerned Police for registration of the

          F.I.R., on a complaint and thereafter the complainant may

          approach the superior authority under Section 36 of the Cr.P.C.

          who may direct for registration of the F.I.R.

                          In the opinion of this Court, the judgment of

          Madras High Court rendered in the case of Seethalakshmi

          (supra) relied upon by Sri Mukul Rohatgi, learned Senior

          Advocate, is not applicable in the facts of the present case. The

          complainant cannot be allowed to approach the police officer

          superior in rank to an officer in-charge of a Police Station, who
 Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.38807 of 2020(15) dt.01-02-2022
                                           28/29




          may exercise the same powers throughout the local area to

          which they are appointed, as may be exercised by such officer

          within the limits of his station. Unless and until, an F.I.R. is

          lodged by the complainant and if the same is not registered by

          the Station House Officer of the concerned Police Station, under

          whose jurisdiction the crime has been committed, the

          complainant cannot approach the superior police officer in rank

          to the Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station. In the opinion of

          this Court, filing of F.I.R. is most essential and the same should

          be done chronologically. Initially, the complainant must try to

          lodge the F.I.R. under Section 154 of the Cr.P.C. as primary duty

          to register F.I.R. is of the Station House Officer of the concerned

          Police Station and if the Station House Officer of the concerned

          Police Station refused to register the F.I.R. then the complainant

          must move under Section 154(3) and under Section 36 of the

          Cr.P.C. by filing a written complaint to the Superintendent of

          Police of the concerned district, who may exercise the same

          powers as being exercised by the Station House Officer of the

          concerned Police Station and on refusal of the same by the

          Superintendent of Police, the complainant may move the Court

          under Section 156 (3) of the Cr.P.C. for registration of the

          complaint and sending it to the Police Station for registration of
           Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.38807 of 2020(15) dt.01-02-2022
                                                     29/29




                    the F.I.R. and investigation.

                                    Considering the above, the submission of Sri

                    Mukul Rohatgi, learned Senior Advocate that Telecom

                    Companies be allowed to file their complaints directly before

                    the Superintendent of Police of concerned district is hereby

                    rejected. The Telecom Companies are directed to register the

                    F.I.R. in the local police stations under whose jurisdiction the

                    offence has been committee and if the Station House Officer of

                    the concerned Police Station does not register the F.I.R. only

                    then the Telecom Companies can approach the concerned

                    Superintendent of Police for registration of the F.I.R. The

                    Telecom Companies cannot approach the Superintendent of

                    Police or the D.G.P. directly for registration of the F.I.R.

                                    List this matter for further hearing on 07.02.2022.



                                                               (Sandeep Kumar, J)
