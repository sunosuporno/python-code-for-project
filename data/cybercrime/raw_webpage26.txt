                          10. The allegations against the applicant as per the prosecution complaint
                               are primarily:-
                                   "During the initial meeting for award of this contract in 2009,
                                   Sh. Sanjay Pandey, one of the founding directors of the

                          11. Ms. Rebecca John, learned senior counsel appearing for the applicant
                              contends the following:
                                   11.1. As per the statement of Sanjay Pandey (one of the co-
                                           accused and director of M/s ISEC), stated that it was Mr.
                                           Ravi Narain who introduced the applicant to Mr. Sanjay
                                           Pandey in 2009.
                                   11.2. Mr. Ravi Narain asked Mr. Sanjay Pandey to send proposal
                                           for the proposed work. It was in fact Ravi Narain who had
                                           decided to utilise the services of Sanjay Pandey and his
                                           company, viz. ISEC Services Pvt. Ltd., and not the
                                           applicant.
                                   11.3. Ms. John, learned senior counsel states that a perusal of the
                                           statements of Ravi Narain and Sanjay Pandey reveal that in
                                           2009 it was Ravi Narain, who was the Managing Director
                                           and at the helm of affairs at NSE, who approved the
                                           proposal submitted by ISEC Services Pvt. Ltd. and directed

                                      implement his instructions. This goes to show that the
                                     Applicant has been wrongly named as an accused in the case
                                     as her role is similar to that of Ravi Varanasi and Mahesh
                                     Haldipur, who were also tasked with the implementation of
                                     the instructions given by Ravi Narain.
                             11.4. The learned senior counsel states that the scheduled offences
                                     against the applicant are under Section 120-B/420 IPC,
                                     Section 72 of the IT Act, 2000 and 13(2) r/w 13(1)(d) of PC
                                     Act, 1988. She further states that in the facts of the present
                                     case none of the ingredients of the aforesaid Sections are
                                     attracted.
                             11.5. As regards Section 420 IPC is concerned, Ms. John, learned
                                     senior counsel has drawn my attention to Section 39 CrPC
                                     under which Section 420 IPC is not an offence for which
                                     any member of the public can go and report a crime to the
                                     Police. She states that the offences under which any member
                                     of the public can go and report a crime are exhaustively
                                     mentioned under Section 39 of the CrPC and Section 420
                                     IPC is not listed therein. Hence, in order to invoke the
                                     ingredients of Section 420 IPC, there must be a person
                                     aggrieved.
                             11.6. In the present case, it cannot be that the NSE is the person
                                     that is aggrieved by the actions of the applicant, as it is
                                     neither the NSE who has registered the FIR nor any of the
                                     employees of NSE whose lines were tapped by the
                                     applicant.

                              11.7. She further states that there is no element of deception, fraud
                                     or dishonest inducement as NSE was, at all times, aware of
                                     the fact that the scope of the "Periodic Study of Cyber
                                     Vulnerabilities" includes electronic monitoring. To further
                                     this contention, she places reliance on the "Proposal for
                                     Periodic Study of Cyber Vulnerabilities" dated 05.02.2013,
                                     27.06.2013,    07.02.2014,    09.02.2015    and     22.01.2016
                                     submitted by ISEC to NSE, which clearly states that ISEC
                                     proposes to "continue" its services in the area of "electronic

                             11.8. With regards to section 120-B IPC, Ms. John, learned senior
                                     counsel states that the same is not a standalone scheduled
                                     offence. The ED in their first and second remand application
                                     states 120B r/w 420 IPC as one of the schedules offences.
                                     Additionally, she states that even the impugned order as
                                     well as reply of the ED also refers to 120B read with other
                                     scheduled offences and section 120-B IPC is not a
                                     standalone offence as far as the Applicant is concerned.
                             11.9. As regards Section 72 of the IT Act is concerned, the
                                     learned senior counsel states that the Applicant or NSE had
                                     never been conferred with any powers in terms of the
                                     Information Technology Act or rules and regulations made
                                     thereunder. Moreover, there is no allegation to this effect in
                                     the FIR either against the Applicant or NSE.
                             11.10. As regards section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption

                                      servant within the meaning of the PC Act. Be that as it may,
                                     assuming under Section 13(1)(d) and 13(2) PC Act that the
                                     applicant is performing a public duty, still there is no illegal
                                     gain or benefit obtained by the applicant. It is not the case
                                     that the applicant has received any kickbacks from the fee of
                                     Rs. 4.54 crores given to M/s ISEC Services Private Limited.
                                     She states that the applicant has not unjustly enriched
                                     herself.
                             11.11. The learned senior counsel submits that the Delhi High
                                     Court in its order dated 15.04.2010 passed in Writ Petition
                                     (CIVIL) No. 4748 of 2007 held NSE to be a public authority
                                     under the RTI Act. The said order has been stayed by the
                                     Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in LPA No. 315 of
                                     2010 vide order dated 04.05.2010 and stay was made
                                     absolute on 21.08.2012. Thus, it is the NSE‟s own case that
                                     NSE is not a public authority.
                             11.12. Lastly, it is the submission of the learned senior counsel for
                                     the applicant that the Proviso of Section 45 PMLA will
                                     apply to the applicant being a woman.
                             11.13. She draws an analogy with Section 437 of the CrPC to state
                                     that an exception is carved out for a woman and even in
                                     cases such as Section 302 IPC, a woman is entitled to bail.
                             11.14. It is submitted that the applicant is in custody since
                                     14.07.2022. The charge sheet has already been filed and the
                                     applicant deserves to be released on bail.
                             11.15. She places reliance on the judgment of the Hon‟ble Supreme

                                      Court viz., Vijay Madanlal Choudhary and Ors. v. UOI
                                     and Ors., 2022 SCC OnLine SC 929 wherein the court
                                     stated:
                                     "388. There is no challenge to the provision on the
                                     ground       of    legislative   competence.    The    question,
                                     therefore, is : whether such classification of offenders
                                     involved      in    the   offence   of   money-laundering         is
                                     reasonable? Considering the concern expressed by the
                                     international        community      regarding    the      money-
                                     laundering activities world over and the transnational
                                     impact thereof, coupled with the fact that the
                                     presumption that the Parliament understands and reacts
                                     to the needs of its own people as per the exigency and
                                     experience gained in the implementation of the law, the
                                     same must stand the test of fairness, reasonableness and
                                     having nexus with the purposes and objects sought to be
                                     achieved by the 2002 Act. Notably, there are several
                                     other legislations where such twin conditions have been
                                     provided for617. Such twin conditions in the concerned
                                     provisions have been tested from time to time and have
                                     stood the challenge of the constitutional validity thereof.
                                     The successive decisions of this Court dealing with
                                     analogous provision have stated that the Court at the

                                     expected to consider the question from the angle as to

                                            rea. The Court is not required to record a positive
                                           finding that the accused had not committed an offence
                                           under the Act. The Court ought to maintain a delicate
                                           balance between a judgment of acquittal and conviction
                                           and an order granting bail much before commencement
                                           of trial. The duty of the Court at this stage is not to
                                           weigh the evidence meticulously but to arrive at a
                                           finding on the basis of broad probabilities. Further, the
                                           Court is required to record a finding as to the possibility
                                           of the accused committing a crime which is an offence
                                           under the Act after grant of bail."

                          12. Per contra, Mr. Hossain, learned standing counsel for ED states:
                                   12.1. Section 120 B IPC is not an offence which is to be read in
                                           conjunction with any other Scheduled offence.
                                   12.2. He states that Section 120 A IPC defines criminal
                                           conspiracy as:
                                           "120A. Definition of criminal conspiracy.--When two or
                                           more persons agree to do, or cause to be done,--
                                           (1) an illegal act, or


                                           (2) an act which is not illegal by illegal means, such an

                                           Provided that no agreement except an agreement to

                                      unless some act besides the agreement is done by one or
                                     more parties to such agreement in pursuance thereof.

                                     Explanation.-- It is immaterial whether the illegal act is
                                     the ultimate object of such agreement, or is merely
                                     incidental to that object."

                             12.3. He states that the definition of 120A IPC reveals that the
                                     agreement between two or more persons to do an illegal act
                                     is the most important ingredient for the offence of
                                     conspiracy. The illegal act may or may not be committed
                                     pursuant to the agreement but the very agreement is an
                                     offence and the conspiracy to commit an illegal act is itself a
                                     standalone scheduled offence which in the present case was
                                     a conspiracy to record and tap telephone lines that violates
                                     the Telegraph Act.
                             12.4. He argues that it is not necessary that the object of the
                                     conspiracy should be achieved. Failing to execute the
                                     conspiracy on account of abandonment or detection before
                                     commission of offence is immaterial as the very act of
                                     entering into an illegal agreement is itself an offence
                                     punishable under law. In this regard, he places reliance on
                                     Yogesh alias Sachin Jagdish Joshi v. State of Maharashtra
                                     (2008) 10 SCC 394 wherein the relevant para reads as

                                      "25. Thus, it is manifest that the meeting of minds of two
                                     or more persons for doing an illegal act or an act by
                                     illegal means is sine qua non of the criminal conspiracy
                                     but it may not be possible to prove the agreement
                                     between them by direct proof. Nevertheless, existence of
                                     the conspiracy and its objective can be inferred from the
                                     surrounding circumstances and the conduct of the
                                     accused. But the incriminating circumstances must form
                                     a chain of events from which a conclusion about the guilt
                                     of the accused could be drawn. It is well settled that an
                                     offence of conspiracy is a substantive offence and
                                     renders the mere agreement to commit an offence
                                     punishable even if an offence does not take place
                                     pursuant to the illegal agreement."

                             12.5. Mr. Hossain has drawn my attention to Part A of the
                                     Schedule under PMLA to show that Section 120 B is a
                                     standalone scheduled offence under the PMLA.
                             12.6. The submission of the learned counsel is that once the
                                     ingredients of Section 120 B are satisfied and there is a
                                     conspiracy to do something illegal, nothing else needs to be
                                     seen. He states that Section 43 of the IPC defines "illegal"
                                     as:

                                     "43. "Illegal". "Legally bound to do".-- The word
                                     "illegal" is applicable to everything which is an offence or

                                      which is prohibited by law, or which furnishes ground for a
                                     civil action; and a person is said to be "legally bound to
                                     do" whatever it is illegal in him to omit."

                             12.7. He contends that the object of criminal conspiracy is to do
                                     something „illegal‟. Thus, the conspiracy to violate the
                                     Telegraph Act by tapping phone lines is an illegal act under
                                     section 4 and 20 of the Telegraph Act and intentionally
                                     tampering with telegraph to acquaint oneself with contents

                                               encyclopedia of the charges. The FIR need not spell out all
                                               the sections. Suffice it to say that if the ingredients of the

                              12.17. It is further stated that monitoring record submitted by ISEC
                                     had no information on cyber vulnerability. It only contained
                                     the conversations recorded of the employees of NSE
                                     identified by the applicant.
                             12.18. Rs. 4,54,00,000/-, the fee received from January 2009 to
                                     February 2017 are therefore proceeds of crime, as they were
                                     pursuant to an illegal act/ activity. He submits that all
                                     approvals were processed through the applicant and given
                                     by her when she was the MD.
                             12.19. The erstwhile M.D., Mr. Ravi Narain in his Section 50
                                     statement has stated that the operational and day to day
                                     functioning was monitored by the applicant.
                             12.20. The tapping of the conversations of the employees were co-
                                     terminus with the Applicant holding key position as
                                     JMD/MD in NSE.
                             12.21. In December 2016, the applicant retired and the contract
                                     with ISEC was not renewed after 13.02.2017.

                                     bailable and cognizable. He states the Hon‟ble Supreme

                                      misunderstanding of the scheme of the 2002 Act. As we
                                     have repeatedly mentioned in the earlier part of this
                                     judgment that the offence of money-laundering is one
                                     wherein a person, directly or indirectly, attempts to
                                     indulge or knowingly assists or knowingly is a party or is
                                     actually involved in any process or activity connected
                                     with the proceeds of crime. The fact that the proceeds of
                                     crime have been generated as a result of criminal activity
                                     relating to a scheduled offence, which incidentally
                                     happens to be a noncognizable offence, would make no
                                     difference. The person is not prosecuted for the
                                     scheduled offence by invoking provisions of the 2002 Act,
                                     but only when he has derived or obtained property as a
                                     result of criminal activity relating to or in relation to a
                                     scheduled offence and then indulges in process or
                                     activity connected with such proceeds of crime. Suffice it
                                     to observe that the argument under consideration is
                                     completely misplaced and needs to be rejected."
                             12.23. He also contends that at this stage, in light of the material
                                     placed on record, no satisfaction of the twin conditions can
                                     be reached hence, bail cannot be granted under section 45
                                     PMLA.
                             12.24. He states the proviso to section 45 PMLA is a discretionary
                                     power of the Court to grant bail to persons falling in the

                                     wherein it was observed:

                                     "9. A perusal of Section 45(1) of PMLA makes it clear
                                     that no person, accused of an offence punishable for a
                                     term of imprisonment of more than three years under
                                     Part A of the Schedule, shall be released on bail or on his
                                     own bond unless twin conditions as stipulated in Section
                                     45(1) are satisfied. Firstly, Public Prosecutor has to be
                                     given an opportunity; secondly in case Public Prosecutor
                                     opposes the application the Court has to be satisfied that
                                     there are reasonable grounds for believing that accused
                                     is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to
                                     commit any offence while on bail.        First proviso is
                                     exception to the above rule and vests power of discretion
                                     to the Court to release on bail the categories of persons,
                                     as notified in the proviso, which includes a woman or a
                                     sick person. I am of the view, that rigours of Section
                                     45(1)(ii) of PMLA will not be applicable to the categories
                                     of persons, as mentioned in the proviso. In case it is held
                                     that conditions as laid in Section 45(1)(ii) shall also be
                                     attracted in respect of the persons, as notified in the
                                     proviso, in my opinion, proviso will be rendered
                                     nugatory, in as much as, an accused will otherwise be

                                           down in section 45(1)(ii).However, in my view,           the
                                           discretion as envisaged in the proviso has to be applied
                                           depending upon the special circumstances attending to
                                           such categories of person and not as a matter of Thumb
                                           rule that all such categories of persons shall necessarily
                                           be granted bail."

                          ANALYSIS:

                          13. I have heard learned counsel for the parties.
                          14. In the present case, for the purpose of this bail application, I am only to
                              decide prima-facie whether the scheduled offences are made out against
                              the Applicant.
                          15. The scheduled offences alleged against the applicant are:
                                   Section 72 of the IT Act
                                   Section 120-B of IPC read with section 420 of IPC
                                   Section 13(2) read with section 13(1)(d) of the PC Act


                          16. Section 72 of the IT Act reads as under:
                                   "72. Penalty for breach of confidentiality and privacy.--
                                   Save as otherwise provided in this Act or any other law for the

                                   such electronic record, book, register, correspondence,
                                   information, document or other material to any other person
                                   shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may
                                   extend to two years, or with fine which may extend to one lakh
                                   rupees, or with both."

                          17. Section 72 of the IT Act is only limited to breach of confidentiality and
                              privacy. The ingredients of the said offence are:

                                 A person has been vested with powers conferred under the Act,
                                   rules or regulations made thereunder;

                                 In pursuance of those powers, that person secured access to any
                                   electronic record, book, register, correspondence, information,
                                   document or other material without the consent of the person
                                   concerned;

                                 Disclosure            of   such   electronic   record,   book,    register,
                                   correspondence, information, document or other material to any
                                   other person.

                          18. As regards section 72 of the IT Act is concerned, the elements of the
                              said offence are not made out in the present case as neither the
                              Applicant nor the NSE was conferred with any powers under the said
                              Act. Moreover, the Applicant or the NSE was not acting in pursuance
                              of the powers conferred under the IT Act or the rules or regulations
                              made therein.

                           19. In Sanjay Pandey v. Directorate of Enforcement BAIL APPLN.
                              2409/2022 vide order 08.12.2022 this court has already held as under:

                                  "41. Sec.72 of the IT Act prescribes the penalty for breach of
                                  confidentiality and privacy. The language of sec. 72 IT Act
                                  categorically states that it penalises only persons acting "in
                                  pursuance of any of the powers conferred under" the IT Act or
                                  the rules or regulations made thereunder. In the present case,
                                  the prosecution under PMLA seems to be predicated on the fact
                                  that by tapping the telephone lines of the employees of NSE, the
                                  applicant has secured access to electronic record without the
                                  consent of that person and is punishable. However, the key
                                  words in section 72 IT Act state that the person who secures
                                  access to electronic record, book, register, correspondence,
                                  information, document or other material has to be in pursuance
                                  of powers conferred under the Act or rules and regulations
                                  made thereunder."

                          20. The contract between NSE and M/s ISEC permitted recording of
                              conversations. Recording or tapping of phone calls sans consent of the
                              concerned persons is an offence punishable under the Indian Telegraph
                              Act and Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act. However, the same are not
                              scheduled offences. Thus, invocation of section 72 of the IT Act is
                              misplaced in the present case.

                          21. The ED has vehemently argued that section 120B of IPC is a
                              standalone scheduled offence. However, the pleadings and case set up
                              by the ED is to the contrary. A bare perusal of the FIR, Prosecution

                               Complaint as well as the Remand Applications make it evident that
                              section 120B IPC has not been invoked as an independent standalone
                              scheduled offence as the same is read with section 420/409 IPC.
                              Section 409 IPC is not a scheduled offence.

                          29. Section 120B of IPC reads as under:

                                 (1) Whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an

                                     manner as if he had abetted such offence.

                          30. With regards to Section 120B IPC, I am of the view that the
                              ingredients of the said offence are not established since the criminal
                              intent i.e., agreement to do an illegal act as defined under sec.120A IPC
                              is not made out.
                          31. In Sanjay Pandey (supra), I have held the following:

                                   "58. The offence under section 120-B IPC (which is also a
                                   PMLA scheduled offence) is also not made out in so far as the
                                   criminal intent i.e., agreement to do an illegal act as defined
                                   under sec.120-A IPC is not established. NSE has been involved
                                   in call-recording since 1997 through other vendors such as M/s
                                   Comtel, prior to ISEC being brought into the picture to analyse

                                    recorded calls. Since call recording was being done prior to the
                                   arrival of ISEC, there is no criminal conspiracy entered into
                                   between ISEC and NSE with the intention of committing an
                                   illegal act, namely, call recording. Thus, the element of
                                   criminal intent is not made out in the present case and no
                                   offence under section 120 B read with 409 and 420 IPC is
                                   established."

                          32. As per the documents placed before me, it is observed that NSE was
                              recording conversations since 1997 through other vendors and the
                              transactions with ISEC occurred from 2009 to 2017. The Applicant was
                              DMD of NSE till 2010 and JMD till 2013 and MD till 2016. As call
                              recording was done by NSE prior to ISEC‟s involvement, it is wrong to
                              allege that the Applicant conspired with ISEC to illegally tap and
                              record calls. Thus, the ingredients of section 120B IPC are not made
                              out in the present case.
                          33. Section 420 of the IPC reads as under:

                                   "420. Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of
                                   property.--Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the

                              Seetharam and Anr. (2019) 16 SCC 739 held that for the offence of

                                   (a) deliver property to any person; or
                                   (b) make, alter or destroy valuable security or anything signed
                                   or sealed and capable of being converted into valuable security.
                                   20. Cheating is an essential ingredient for an act to constitute
                                   an offence under Section 420."
                          35. In the present case, there was no complaint from NSE or any employee
                              of the NSE that the Applicant cheated NSE or its employees.
                              Furthermore, there is no allegation that the Applicant deceived or
                              fraudulently induced NSE to deliver any property to any person.
                          36. As far as the business arrangement with M/s ISEC is concerned, there is
                              no difference between NSE and the management of NSE, including the
                              Applicant. The business contract was between M/s ISEC and NSE for
                              which NSE made payments to M/s ISEC.
                          37. The Applicant was at all times acting on behalf of NSE and

                               representing NSE in her capacity as DMD/JMD/MD of NSE. She
                              carried out her duties in the capacity of DMD/JMD/MD of NSE,
                              therefore, it is wrong to allege that the Applicant deceived or
                              fraudulently induced NSE to enter into an agreement with M/s ISEC
                              and make payments to M/s ISEC.
                          38. The documents titled "Periodic Study of Cyber Vulnerabilities" clearly
                              records that M/s ISEC proposes to "continue" its services in the area of
                              "electronic monitoring services at NSE". Since NSE was at all times
                              aware that the scope of "Periodic Study of Cyber Vulnerabilities"
                              includes electronic monitoring, there is no deception, fraud or dishonest
                              inducement on the part of the Applicant.
                          39. Pertinently, no victim has been identified by the ED who has suffered a
                              wrongful loss on account of deception or cheating by the Applicant.
                              Except for a vague and bald averment that customers have been
                              cheated, there is no mention of the names of the persons who have been
                              cheated. Thus, the ingredients of section 420 IPC are not made out in
                              the present case.
                          40. In view of the above, prima facie the ingredients of the scheduled
                              offences under IPC viz., Section 120B read with section 420 IPC are
                              not made out against the Applicant.

                          42. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court has outlined the essential ingredients for

                           43. The ingredients of Section 13(1)(d) of the PC Act are not made out in
                              the present case as the Applicant is not a public servant within the
                              meaning of the PC Act. NSE is not a public authority. In this regard, the
                              learned senior counsel for the Applicant had brought to my notice the
                              order dated 04.05.2010 of the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court
                              in LPA No. 315 of 2010 wherein this court stayed the order of the
                              learned Single Judge holding NSE to be public authority. The stay was
                              made absolute on 21.08.2012. Thus, since NSE is not a public
                              authority, the Applicant is not a public servant.
                          44. In addition, the ED has also failed to show how the Applicant has
                              obtained for herself or for any other person any valuable thing or
                              pecuniary advantage within the meaning of section 13 of PC Act.
                          45. There is no evidence placed on record to prove corruption or abuse of
                              position by the Applicant. The consideration received by M/s ISEC is
                              pursuant to a contract entered into with NSE and work orders issued
                              with the approval of Mr. Ravi Narain, the Managing Director. Thus, the
                              ingredients of section 13(1)(d) r/w 13(2) PC Act are not made out
                              against the Applicant. Hence, scheduled offence under section 13 PC
                              Act is not established against the Applicant.
                          46. Since I have held above that prima facie no scheduled offences against
                              the Applicant are established, the provisions of PMLA cannot be
                              attracted to the present case.
                          47. After conclusion of arguments, I was informed that the Applicant has
                              been granted regular bail by the Ld. Special Judge, Rouse Avenue in
                              RC No. 2212022E0030 dated 07.07.2022 vide order dated 21.12.2022.

                           48. The Applicant has sought bail under section 45 PMLA. According to
                              Section 45 PMLA, the two conditions for grant of bail are:
                              (i)       public prosecutor has to be given an opportunity to oppose bail
                                        and;
                              (ii)      there are reasonable grounds to believe that the accused is not
                                        guilty of the offence and the accused is not likely to commit any
                                        offence while on bail.
                          49. Addressing the second condition, the ingredients of section 3 PMLA
                              are culled out as follows:
                                      A person who directly or indirectly attempts to indulge or
                                        knowingly assists, or knowingly is a party, or is actually
                                        involved;
                                      In any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime
                                        including its concealment, possession, acquisition or use and
                                        projecting or claiming it as untainted property.

                          50. This court in Sanjay Pandey (supra) has held as under:

                                      "77. I am of the view that in the present case, no scheduled
                                      offence is prima facie made out, concomitantly there cannot be
                                      proceeds of crime having been generated as there is no
                                      criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. This position
                                      is in consonance with the dicta of Vijay Madanlal Choudhary
                                      (supra) where the Hon‟ble Supreme Court held as under:
                                          "406.... The fact that the proceeds of crime have been

                                          scheduled offence, which incidentally happens to be a
                                         noncognizable offence, would make no difference. The
                                         person is not prosecuted for the scheduled offence by
                                         invoking provisions of the 2002 Act, but only when he
                                         has derived or obtained property as a result of
                                         criminal activity relating to or in relation to a
                                         scheduled offence and then indulges in process or
                                         activity connected with such proceeds of crime. Suffice
                                         it to observe that the argument under consideration is
                                         completely misplaced and needs to be rejected."

                                   78. Since none of the ingredients of the scheduled offences viz.,
                                   Section 72 IT Act, Section 120B r/w 409 and 420 IPC, Section
                                   13(2) read with 13(1)(d) PC Act are made out, there is no
                                   occasion to allege acquisition or retention of „proceeds of
                                   crime‟, which under Section 2(u) of PMLA is defined to mean
                                   proceeds arising out of „scheduled offences.‟ "

                          51. In the case of Vijay Madanlal Choudhary (supra) the Hon‟ble
                              Supreme Court has opined that provisions of PMLA would apply when
                              a person has derived or obtained property as a result of a scheduled
                              offence, and then indulged in any process or activity connected with
                              such property.
                          52. In the present case there is no allegation that the Applicant has derived
                              or obtained any property or proceeds of crime. Additionally, there is no
                              allegation or evidence produced before me to suggest that the Applicant

                               has concealed, possessed, used, projected or claimed any proceeds of
                              crime as untainted property.
                          53. Respondent has relied upon the judgment of this Hon‟ble Court in Mrs
                              Shivani Rajiv Saxena vs. Directorate of Enforcement & Anr, order
                              dated 15.09.2017 in Bail Appl. 1518/2017 to contend that the discretion
                              under the proviso to section 45 PMLA may not be exercised in cases
                              where the accused has played an active role in the offence of money
                              laundering. The said decision of this court is not applicable to the
                              present case as the facts of that case stand on a different footing.
                          54. In Shivani Saxena‟s (supra) case, the court was of the view that the
                              Applicant therein was a partner/director in both the companies which
                              were accused of money laundering. The court was of the view that they
                              were carriers of proceeds of crime. The present case is distinguishable
                              as I have already given a prima facie finding that the applicant is not
                              guilty of scheduled offences.
                          55. In view of my findings above, I have not dealt with the argument of the
                              Applicant being entitled to bail on account of being a woman under the
                              proviso to section 45 PMLA.
                          56. Prima facie there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Applicant
                              is not guilty of the offence and she is not likely to commit any offence
