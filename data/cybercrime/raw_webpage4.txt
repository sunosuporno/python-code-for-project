          ---------------------------------------------------------------------
              Dated this the 18th day of March, 2014


                                    O R D E R

          This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by

accused Nos. 1 to 4 in Crime No.20/2012 of Cyber Crime

Police  Station,         Thiruvananthapuram,                        to      quash the

proceedings, recording the settlement under Section 482 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter called the

`Code').

          2.     It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioners are accused' in Crime No.20/2012 of Cyber

Crime Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram, which was

registered on the basis of the statement given by the first

respondent, alleging offence under Section 498 A read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 66 E, 66 D

and 67 of Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008.

Now the matter has been settled between the parties in the

Crl.M.C. No.5807 of 2013
                                  2

case, which was pending as M.C.No.39/2011 before the

Judicial        First       Class      Magistrate         Court-II,

Thiruvananthapuram, in a mediation, as per Annexure-II

compromise petition, in which it was agreed between the

parties that, all cases including the criminal cases will be

withdrawn by the parties. Since, the case is in the crime

stage, neither the police nor the court below will drop the

proceedings. So the petitioners have no other remedy,

except to approach this court, seeking the following relief:

            "It is most humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court
      may be pleased to pass an order quashing Annexure-I
      first  information    report and    all   consequential
      proceedings against the petitioners by invoking the
      inherent powers conferred upon this Hon'ble Court
      under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to
      secure the ends of justice."

            3.    Earlier, the first respondent appeared and

filed counter stating that, some of the conditions mentioned

in the compromise have not been fulfilled and so the

petition cannot be allowed. But later, the conditions were

complied with and the counsel for the first respondent

submitted that, since the conditions in the compromise have

Crl.M.C. No.5807 of 2013
                                 3

been fulfilled, the first respondent has no objection in

allowing the application.
            4.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner

and learned Public Prosecutor also.

            5.    It is an admitted fact that, on the basis of the

statement given by the first respondent, who is the wife of

the first petitioner, crime No.20/2012 was registered by

Cyber Crime Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram, alleging

offences under Section 498 A read with Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code and Section 66 E, 66 D and 67 of

Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008.                 The

investigation is not completed. It is also an admitted fact

that, between the first petitioner and the first respondent,

there was another case as M.C.No.39/2011 before the

Judicial        First       Class     Magistrate        Court-II,

Thiruvananthapuram. In that case, the matter has been

settled and Annexure-AII, compromise petition was filed

and that case was disposed of on that basis. It is on that

basis, that the present petition has been field. But at the

Crl.M.C. No.5807 of 2013
                                4

time, when the petition was field and notice was served on

the first respondent, the matter has not been completely

settled, and condition No.6 mentioned in the compromise

petition has not been complied with and it was posted for

compliance of that condition for some time. Now both sides

submitted that, the document as mentioned in condition

No.6 in Annexure-A2 has been executed and the documents

were handed over to the first respondent.         So, the first

respondent has no objection in quashing the proceedings.

            6.    It is a matrimonial dispute, which resulted in

registering of the crime. Though certain offences under the

Information Technology Act were also incorporated, the

parties have amicably settled those issues as well and the

impugned articles have been handed over to the first

respondent and she is satisfied with the same. No purpose

will be served by proceeding with the investigation, as the

first respondent is not going to support the investigation in

view of the settlement arrived at between the parties.

Further, there is a condition in the compromise that, in

Crl.M.C. No.5807 of 2013
                                   5

view of the settlement, the first respondent will withdraw

all the cases including the criminal cases filed by her

against her husband and relatives, who are the petitioners

herein.

            7.    In the decision reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], the Hon'ble

Supreme Court has held that:

            "In family disputes, if the parties have settled the
      issues, due to the intervention of well-wishers and the
      family members and does not want to proceeded with the
      criminal prosecution initiated, then that must be
      honoured and the prosecution has to be quashed,
      invoking the power under Section 482 of the Code."

            8.    In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that, it is a family

dispute, which resulted in registering the crime and that

has been settled between the parties and no purpose will be

served by proceeding with the case, in view of the

settlement, this court feels that, it is a fit case where the

power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

can be invoked to quash the proceedings to promote the

settlement arrived at between the petitioners and the first

Crl.M.C. No.5807 of 2013
                                  6

respondent due to the intervention of the family members

and also to provide a better future life for both the parties

and this case should not be a hurdle for that.              So the

application is allowed and further proceedings in Crime

No.20/2012          of   Cyber      Crime     Police       Station,

Thiruvananthapuram, against the petitioners is quashed.

Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned magistrate court, namely, Chief Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram, so as to

inform the concerned police Station for further action in

this regard.

            With the above direction and observation, the

petition is disposed of.
