2204/2014


W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters           Page 2 of 96
          This is an application filed by the respondent to take on record the

additional documents.

         In view of the reasons stated in the application, the same is

allowed. The additional affidavit is taken on record. Application stands

disposed of.

W.P.(C) Nos. 2204/2014, 4597/2014, 8098/2015, 8110/2015, 4279/2015
& 6129/2015

1.       As the reliefs in all the writ petitions are identical with almost

similar facts, the same are being decided by this common order.

2.       The writ petition No.2204/2014 Mohit Panwar & Ors. vs. Airport

Authority of India is being considered as a lead case, even though the

facts of each writ petition would be noted separately, the stand of the

respondent would be seen/considered from the pleadings filed in this

petition.

Writ Petition (C) No. 2204/2014

3.       The nine petitioners in this writ petition have challenged the

notification dated March 21, 2014, whereby it was decided to redo the

entire selection process afresh for the posts published vide advertisement

No.02/2012 dated March 01, 2012 and seeking a further direction to the

respondent to issue appointment letters to the petitioners who were found

suitable and selected provisionally for the post of Junior Executive

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                     Page 3 of 96
 (Engineering-Civil) and Junior Executive (Engineering-Electrical).

4.       It is the case of the petitioners that the respondent invited

applications from eligible candidates for filling up the posts inter-alia of

Junior       Executive          (Engineering-Civil)   and   Junior     Executive

(Engineering-Electrical) in the Airports Authority of India vide

notification/advertisement No.02/2012 dated March 01, 2012. All the

petitioners appeared for the written examination on August 26, 2012 and

qualified it successfully. Pursuant thereto, the petitioners appeared for

the interview in the month of December, 2012. The respondent published

the final result in the month of January, 2013, wherein it was stated that

the petitioners are provisionally selected for the posts of Junior

Executive (Engineering-Civil) and Junior Executive (Engineering-

Electrical) and their offer letters will be issued shortly. It is also the case

of the petitioners that the respondent issued offer of appointment to the

candidates who applied for the post of Junior Executive (Fire Services).

In the month of April/May, 2013, to their shock and surprise the

respondent published a notice on its website stating that for

administrative reasons the recruitment related to the posts advertised

vide advertisement No.02/2012 dated March 01, 2012 has been put on

hold/withheld until further orders. The petitioner No.9 made a

representation vide e-mail dated June 11, 2013 but was of no avail.
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                        Page 4 of 96
 Similarly, the petitioner No.2 also made a representation dated June 20,

2013 requesting the respondent to issue offer of appointment, but the

said request was also not acceded to. Similarly, the e-mail dated

September 06, 2013 of the petitioner No.3 has not been answered. It was

only on the application under RTI dated November 20, 2013 to know the

status of issuance of appointment letters that a response was received

from the respondent on January 10, 2014 stating that the appointment

letters have been withheld due to some administrative reasons and no

other information is available with them regarding the advertisement

No.02/2012.

5.       They initially          filed a writ petition No.841/2014 which was

disposed of vide order dated February 05, 2014 in the light of writ

petition No.399/2014 wherein it was directed that the competent

authority to take a decision in the matter with expedition not later than

eight weeks from February 05, 2014. The impugned notification dated

March 21/2014 is a decision on the advertisement No.02/2012, whereby

it has been decided to redo the selection process afresh under

advertisement No.02/2012.

6.       It may be necessary to state here, when the writ petition was listed

for hearing on April 02, 2014, it was stated on behalf of the respondent

that the respondent is likely to take some time informing the date for
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                      Page 5 of 96
 fresh examination. It was also stated that the fresh examination is

confined only to those who appeared in the examination earlier for the

post of Manager/Junior Executive in different disciplines except for the

post of Junior Executive (Fire Services).         This Court directed the

respondent to approach the Court before a firm date for the examination

is publicized.

7.       It is the case of the respondent in its counter-affidavit filed

initially, that in terms of advertisement No.02/2012 dated March 01,

2012 applications were invited from eligible candidates for filling up of

588 vacancies at E-1, E-3 and E-6 level for the post of Junior Executive,

Manager and Deputy General Manager respectively in 33 grades

including 50 vacancies each of Junior Executive (Engineering-Civil),

Junior Executive (Engineering-Electrical). In January, 2013 the

respondent had on its website made available a list of candidates

provisionally selected for the post of Junior Executive (Information

Technology), Junior Executive (Fire Services), Junior Executive

(Engineering-Civil) and Junior Executive (Engineer-Electrical). Before

issuing offer of appointment for the post of Junior Executive (IT),

Chairman, Airport Authority of India vide note dated February 04, 2013

forwarded the concerned file to the CVO for comments/observation.

8.       That prior to investigation by Vigilance Directorate in the matter,
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                    Page 6 of 96
 the appointment letters were already issued to the five successful

candidates for the post of Junior Executive (Fire Services). The said

candidates had completed their training and were appointed on the basis

of successful completion of training.

9.       Pursuant to the note dated February 04, 2013 of the Chairman, the

CVO         vide       note       dated     February   08,     2013         called    for

documents/information against the advertisement No.02/2012 and

thereafter through several communications/instructions also called for all

the relevant files as per their requirement in the month of March, 2013

onwards.        Meanwhile,           pending   investigation   by     the     Vigilance

Directorate, the Chairman of the respondent vide his note dated April

04,2013 decided to defer the process as the CVO in the said note opined

that the investigation is under process and prima facie it appears that the

role of the agency may not be above Board and recommended that the

agency may not be involved in conducting any examination till such time

the investigations are concluded. Thereafter, a notice was put on the

website of the respondent on May 10, 2013 stating therein that due to

administrative reasons the recruitment process relating to advertisement

No.02/2012 has been put on hold. The Vigilance Directorate examined

the process of recruitment and submitted a preliminary report to the

Chairman as per which several irregularities were noticed in the
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                              Page 7 of 96
 recruitment process especially the written examination conducted by the

agency. Thereafter the Chairman of the respondent organization

approved to refer the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation on

recommendation of the CVO and the same was refered vide letter dated

May 30, 2013. Keeping in view the gravity in the matter, the respondent

organization felt, as the recruitment exercise cannot be kept in abeyance

indefinitely waiting for the findings by the CBI, a legal advice was taken

wherein it was opined that an inquiry committee may be constituted to

inquire whether in the light of the facts and notwithstanding the criminal

investigation by the CBI, the cancellation of the previous examination

was warranted and consequently a fresh examination was to be

constituted. In case the inquiry committee or the competent authority as

the case may be, comes to a conclusion that the selection process has

been tainted with irregularities for even there are some justifiable doubts

without there being any direct evidence thereto that the declared list of

candidates is dubious, the queriest may forthwith proceed with

cancellation of the existing list and undertake the process of conducting

the process afresh. The Committee headed by the Executive Director

(Technical) opined in its report dated November 7/12, 2013, that the

respondent may redo the process of written examination afresh without

involving the agency in question for the candidates already enrolled and
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                   Page 8 of 96
 appeared in the written examination as if the candidates have reported

for examination but examination or further process had not happened in

the past. However, it should be subject to same number of vacancies

which were existing at the time of conducting the examination minus the

incumbants already joined as in the case of fire will remain same.

According to the Committee, there should not be any change in any of

the notified conditions.

10.      The respondent had also referred to the orders passed by this Court

in writ petition No.399/2014 titled Vikas Bhardwaj vs. Airport

Authority of India wherein the Court had disposed of the petition by

noting that the report of the Committee is required to be placed before

the competent authority for taking a decision in the matter and further

the direction of the Court to take a decision though not later than eight

weeks. Accordingly, the report of the Committee was approved by the

Competent Authority on January 31, 2014, which was followed by the

notification dated March 21, 2014.

11.      The counter-affidavit also refers to the report of the Vigilance

Directorate submitted to the competent authority on April 24, 2014. It

may also be relevant to state here, along with the counter-affidavit the

respondent had filed CM No.8554/2014 for directions so that fresh dates

of examination could be notified and the selection process can be
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                    Page 9 of 96
 completed as per schedule. The reply to the said application was filed by

the petitioners, wherein they have objected to the right of the respondent

to cancel the examination in view of the settled law and need to

segregate tainted from untainted candidates.

12.      During the course of hearing on November 13, 2014, it was

submitted on behalf of respondent that there is some internal rethinking

on the issues raised in the present petition and if granted a week‟s time

an affidavit shall be filed. The additional affidavit was filed on

November 22, 2014. In the additional affidavit, the following is the case

of respondent herein:-

         (a) The number of candidates who had appeared for the

examination have been far below the number of candidates who had

applied. Infact the total number of applicants were 135367 against which

only 33037 candidates appeared.

         (b) Vigilance has found the e-mails to the candidates requesting to

download the hall tickets were not sent before commencement of the

written test on August 26, 2012. Also it was not checked that how many

candidates have downloaded their hall tickets. This casual approach

might have led to lower percentage (19% as per vigilance investigation)

of candidates turning up for the written examination.

         (c) With the passage of time which is almost two years, moreso
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                    Page 10 of 96
 the candidates who had applied/appeared earlier might have got adjusted

at other places and if the earlier decision to redo the examination from

only amongst those candidates who had appeared/applied pursuant to the

examination conducted earlier is followed, the competition would be

very-very restrictive denying the authority of the priviledge to get the

best talent in the country.

13.      It is also the case of the respondent that the new Competent

Authority reviewed the decision dated January 31, 2014 finally on

November 19, 2014, it was decided to scrap the entire process pursuant

to advertisement No.02/2012 and issue fresh advertisement for the

vacancies advertised vide the said advertisement inviting fresh

applications in general and to allow all the candidates who had applied

earlier and to give age relaxation as well as fee relaxation and also, the

appointment of five candidates who had joined the Airports Authority of

India as junior Executive (Fire Services) shall be subject to outcome of

the investigations. In other words, in view of the decision of the

Chairman dated November 19, 2014 the notification dated March 21,

2014 would stand withdrawn and the answering respondent shall issue a

fresh notification at the earliest.

14.      The respondent filed a further affidavit on January 21, 2015 giving

reference to the proceedings held before the Court on January 08, 2015,
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                    Page 11 of 96
 wherein it was indicated to the respondent to re-examine the issue as to

whether the Airports Authority of India is willing to investigate with

regard to other cadres apart from Junior Executive (IT) which was

investigated by the Vigilance Directorate. According to the respondent,

the matter was re-examined in the organization and it was of the view

that the detailed investigation was done by the Vigilance Directorate

with regard to the examination held for the post of JE (IT) as a test case

and Vigilance Directorate came to a definite conclusion that there were

large scale irregularities in the entire selection process. The irregularities

were serious in nature and cast a doubt on the accuracy of the results and

the integrity of the recruiting agency. Since the exam conducted for one

of the disciplines i.e. the post of JE (IT) was not above Board, it is

perfectly logical and right to have a doubt on the credibility of entire

selection process and results of the other exams conducted by the

recruiting agency at the same time for other cadres. It is also the stand of

the respondent that a Committee was constituted in connection with the

recruitment work undertaken by the agency which submitted its report

on November 7/12, 2013, which went into the irregularities committed

by the agency with regard to other cadres apart from JE(IT). According

to the respondent, as per the statistics it is clearly observed that the

maximum number of candidates in top 100 were from Delhi/NCR
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                      Page 12 of 96
 notwithstanding the fact that examination conducted was on All India

basis and there was no specialised qualification which candidates of only

Delhi/NCR possessed. It is also the case of the respondent that most of

the candidates who had applied were not sent their admit cards and hence

a large number of candidates could not take the examination. Further, it

is the respondent‟s stand that the result received from the agency were

analysed by the HR, Directorate, vide their note dated October 01, 2012

and it was proposed that the department of HR considering that the

maximum number of candidates to be called for interview are residents

of Delhi/NCR and hence the interview may be held at Delhi only and the

candidates selected from other part of country may be called to Delhi.

However, the said proposal could not be finalised as it was decided that

interview may be held as per the instructions contained in the

advertisement but from the analysis made it is clear that the maximum

number of candidates belong to Delhi/NCR which is very uncommon.

The respondent also referred to the preliminary report of the Vigilance

Directorate, wherein it indicated various irregularities and further

recommended that it is a case of not only discrepancies related to

procedure and monitoring, but irregularities committed are the nature of

criminal misconduct for manipulating the written examination.             The

respondent also referred to the report wherein it was recommended that
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                 Page 13 of 96
 there is no requirement to wait for consolidated report of all disciplines

as one would constitute sufficient ground for sending the report to CBI.

It is the stand of the respondent that in the light of the situation

explained, the exercise of investigating other exams is completely

unproductive and will only lead to wastage of precious time for both the

Airports Authority of India and the petitioner candidates. Since a lot of

time has lapsed in the process and the authority is a premier organization

of the Country and performing very sensitive nature of service, therefore

had decided to issue a fresh advertisement inviting fresh applications for

the vacancies notified in the earlier advertisement and also allow the

candidates to appear who had applied pursuant to the earlier

advertisement to appear in the fresh examination to be conducted by

granting them age and free relaxation, wherever applicable. It is their

stand that the decision to scrap the examination is uniform without any

bias and favouritism. It gives equal opportunity to all and encourages

competition. Since the role of agency which has conducted the

examination is under cloud, no resort to clear the chaff from the grain

can be taken.

15.      No reply to the said affidavit was filed by the petitioner. On

January 22, 2015, a suggestion was made on behalf of the petitioners that

the respondent can go ahead with regard to 500 odd other posts other
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                  Page 14 of 96
 than to which the petitioners are contenders and they should examine the

issue of "grain and chaff" qua the petitioners i.e. whether any irregularity

can be shown so far as the selection process of the petitioners is

concerned and only in such circumstance the petitioners may possibly

not have any right either for appointment or for drawing of a select

list/merit list. The matter was again taken up for hearing on May 01,

2015, when this Court noting, the submission of the learned ASG on

instructions that the respondent will endeavour to conduct a specific

inquiry and investigation as to whether there can be separation of the

tainted from untainted candidates in the facts of the present case with

regard to the posts of JE (Electrical), JE (Civil), JE (IT), passed a very

detail order and was of the view that the respondent must with

expedition and necessary resources at its command, conduct an inquiry

and investigation with respect to the petitioners for the aforesaid posts in

the Centres in which they had appeared and file its report as regards

separation of tainted from untainted candidates, if possible in the facts of

this case. The respondent filed an affidavit on August 05, 2015. It is the

stand of the respondent that based on an investigation, the competent

authority had accepted the preliminary report dated May 21, 2015 on

July 27, 2015, wherein it has been found that success rate in terms of

percentage of the candidates who opted Delhi as a centre, is
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                    Page 15 of 96
 disproportionately high and the recruitment process has been

manipulated to favour set of candidates (petitioners) belonging to Delhi

region mainly Haryana State or those candidates who have obtained

qualifying degree from the State and the higher written marks of these

candidates do not match with their poor credentials with the average

marks obtained by All India candidates with better credentials.

According to the respondent, the finding reiterates the investigation done

by the Directorate of Vigilance and the preliminary report of the

Directorate on the basis of which criminal investigations are pending.

16.      The respondent would state that the investigation has further

revealed that large percentage of options exercised by the petitioners of

wrong questions matches with each other, which is abnormal while

making one out of four options when the booklet series were different.

Had there been a fair competition, such similarities in the result of

written examination in all these disciplines were not possible by any

means. It is their case that the report also pointed out the possibilities

which existed for the manipulation of the results and finally arrived at a

conclusion that on careful examination of the answering patterns, results

of the written examination, the centre of examinations and credentials of

the petitioners viz a viz other candidates, it appears that the petitioners

belonged to category of tainted candidates. They referred to one of the
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                   Page 16 of 96
 petitioners namely Naveen, petitioner No.33, S/o Sh. Om Prakash, Roll

No.117315. According to investigation, he did not appear in the written

test held for the post of Junior Executive (Airport-Operations).

Similarly, Sh. Manu Yadav, S/o Deputy Singh Yadav having Roll No.

118065 and being petitioner No. 35 in W.P.(C) No. 4597/2014 did not

appear in the interview for the post of Junior Executive (Airport-

Operations). The respondent would state, the allegations/malpractices

against the agency M/S C.P.R are very serious and as the Airports

Authority of India does not have resources to investigate the outside

agency like M/S C.P.R., candidates etc, hence on the recommendation of

CBI, the matter has been referred to the Crime Branch for investigation

and FIR has been registered. The respondent would also state, that this

investigation i.e preliminary report dated May 21, 2015 was not there

before the Competent Authority when a decision was taken to scrap the

entire recruitment process.                 The documents before the Competent

Authority were the preliminary report submitted to the Chairman on May

9, 2013 and report of the committee dated November 7, 2013. Hence,

the Airports Authority of India relies upon the preliminary report by the

Directorate of Vigilance and the report of the committee and at best the

preliminary report of the inquiry or investigation pursuant to the orders

passed by this Court
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                         Page 17 of 96
 Writ Petition (C) No. 6129/2015

17.      This writ petition has been filed by the petitioner inter-alia seeking

the reliefs for quashing notification dated March 21, 2014 and for a

direction against the respondent authority to issue appointment letter for

the post of Junior Executive (Engineering-Information Technology) and

fix the seniority from the date appointment letters were issued to the

persons appointed as Junior Executive (Fire-Services). It is the case of

the petitioner, that pursuant to the advertisement dated March 1, 2012 of

the respondent authority inviting applications for around 558 vacancies

for 33 different post including Junior Executive (Engineering-

Information Technology), the petitioner applied for the aforesaid post

and was called to appear in the written examination held on August 26,

2012. The results of the written examination were declared on October

15, 2012. He was called for the interview on November 26, 2012. The

respondent authority prepared, finalized and uploaded the final select list

for the post of Junior Executive (Engineering-Civil), Junior Executive

(Engineering-Electrical), Junior Executive (Fire-Services) and Junior

Executive (Information-Technology), wherein the petitioner was

declared successful and was intimated that the offer of appointment will

be issued shortly. Immediately thereafter, the appointment letters were

issued to the Junior Executive (Fire-Services). The petitioner having not
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                       Page 18 of 96
 received the appointment letter, had vide e-mail dated February 8, 2013

and April 8, 2013, sought to inquire with regard to the issuance of the

appointment letter from the respondent. However, petitioner did not

receive any reply for the same. He, to his shock, came to know that the

respondent authority had vide notice published on the website

represented that due to administrative reasons the recruitment process

relating to the post advertised vide advertisement No. 2/2012 dated

March 1, 2012 has been put on hold until further orders. The petitioner

having failed to elicit any response was constrained to seek information

requesting issuance of the appointment letters in terms of the final select

list published by the respondent vide e-mails dated July 5, 2013, October

16, 2013 and October 30, 2013. The petitioner sought to inquire from

the Department of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances, Govt.

of India also. However, the respondent authority gave a vague and

unreasoned reply. He would also refer to filing of the W.P.(C) No.

399/2014, issuance of notification dated March 21, 2014 by the

respondent authority. He would also refer to W.P.(C) No. 2204/2014

wherein a similar challenge has been made and also in W.P.(C) No.

4597/2014. He would also state, that having come to know about the

pendency of W.P. (C) No. 4597/2014, he filed CM No. 14388/2014 in

the said writ petition seeking impleadment, wherein liberty was given to
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                   Page 19 of 96
 file independent proceedings.

18.      The respondent had filed a detailed counter-affidavit. One of the

preliminary objections taken by the respondent is, of issue of delay and

laches. It is the stand of the respondent, that the petitioner was fully

aware of notification dated March 21, 2014.             However instead of

approaching the court, the petitioner was sitting on the fence awaiting

the outcome of W.P.(C) No. 2204/2014.              Much water has flown

inasmuch as this Court had directed the Airports Authority of India to

continue with fresh selection process for appointment to other posts than

to which the petitioners were contenders. In the absence of any proper

explanation for delay, the petition is liable to be dismissed. Insofar as

the other contents of the counter affidavit are concerned, suffice to state

that, as I have already reproduced the stand of the respondent Airports

Authority of India in the pleadings in W.P(C) No.2204/2014 and

additional affidavits filed from time to time in the said writ petition, for

the sake of brevity, I would not refer to the same once again.

Writ Petition (C) No. 4597/2014

19.      The thirty three (33) petitioners have filed this petition inter-alia

seeking for quashing the notification dated March 21, 2014 issued by the

respondent with a further direction to the respondent to forthwith issue

offer of appointment/appointment letters to the petitioners who were
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                      Page 20 of 96
 found suitable and were selected provisionally for the post of Junior

Executive (Engineering-Electrical) and Junior Executive (Information

Technology) and also for a direction to declare the results/final merit list

of the selection process for the post of Junior Executive (Airport-

Operations) and issue forthwith offer of appointment/appointment letters

to the said petitioners who were found suitable/successful and fix their

seniority from the date when the appointment letters had been issued to

the Junior Executive (Fire-Services). Suffice to state, it is the case of the

petitioners that they have been provisionally selected for the post of

Junior Executive (Engineering-Electrical), Junior Executive (Information

Technology). They also referred to filing of W.P.(C) No. 841/2014

which was disposed of on February 5, 2014 in the light of the directions

in W.P.(C) No. 399/2014 wherein it was directed that the competent

authority to take a decision in the matter with expedition not later than

eight weeks from February 5, 2014.          They referred to the filing of

W.P.(C) No. 2204/2014.

20.      Rest of the contents of the writ petition being in common to the

writ petitions dealt above, for the sake of brevity, the said facts are not

reiterated. The learned counsel for the parties made a statement on July

25, 2014 that they would rely on the pleadings in W.P.(C) No.

2204/2014. As such no separate counter affidavit has been filed in the
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                     Page 21 of 96
 writ petition.

Writ Petition (C) No. 4279/2015

21.      This writ petition has been filed by ten (10) petitioners inter-alia

challenging the notification dated March 21, 2014, and seeking a further

direction to issue appointment letters to the petitioners who were

selected for the post of Junior Executive (Engineering-Civil), Junior

Executive (Engineering-Electrical), and Junior Executive (Information

Technology) and for a further direction to fix their seniority from the

date when the appointment letters were issued to the Junior Executive

(Fire Services). It is their case that they had applied for the post of

Junior Executive (Engineering-Civil), Junior Executive (Engineering-

Electrical) and after the process of written examination and interview the

petitioners were declared successful to the posts of Junior Executive

(Engineering-Civil), Junior Executive (Engineering-Electrical).               They

were waiting impatiently for their appointment letters, till, to their shock

the respondent authority had vide notice published on its website stated

due to administrative reasons, the recruitment process has been put on

hold. Their repeated representations were unsuccessful. They referred

to the W.P.(C) No. 399/2014 filed by similarly placed candidates. They

referred to notification dated March 21, 2014 whereby it was decided to

redo the entire selection process afresh. They referred to W.P.(C) No.
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                     Page 22 of 96
 2204/2014 and the order passed by this Court staying the recruitment

process pursuant to advertisement No. 02/2012.                  They referred to

W.P.(C) No. 4597/2014 challenging the decision of the respondent

authority dated March 21, 2014.             It is their case that they came to know

about the W.P.(C) No. 2204/2014 through the petitioners in the said writ

petition in the second week of February 2015.                   When they made

inquiries from the respondent, they were told that the matter is subjudice

before the Court in W.P.(C) No. 2204/2014 and they would abide by the

decision/direction issued therein which would cover the case of the

petitioners also and the respondent in the meantime has come up with

fresh advertisement No. 02/2015 in respect of 28 posts.                             They

accordingly, filed a CM No.6385/2015 in W.P.(C) No. 2204/2014

seeking impleadment and appropriate directions claiming to be similarly

situated as the petitioners in the said writ petition. This Court granted

liberty to file separate and independent proceedings and hence the

petition.

22.      The respondent has filed a counter affidavit. One of the objections

is that the petition is hit by delay and laches. Suffice to state, it is the

stand of the respondent that the challenge to the notification dated March

21, 2014, which the petitioners were aware of in the month of April 2014

is hit by delay and laches. Rest of the contents of the counter affidavit
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                           Page 23 of 96
 being similar to the pleadings and the affidavits in W.P(C)

No.2204/2014, for the sake of brevity, are not repeated once again.

Writ Petition (C) No. 8098/2015

23.      This writ petition has been filed by two petitioners inter-alia

seeking a direction to the respondent to draw up selection/merit list for

the post they have been found successful for appointment to the post of

Junior Executive (Airport-Operations) in the selection process initiated

by advertisement No.2/2012 and appoint the petitioners to the said post

and for a direction to the respondent to investigate the credentials of the

petitioners on the principles elucidated in Joginder Pal vs. State of

Punjab 2014 6 SCC 644.                      It is the case of the petitioners that an

advertisement No.02/2012 was issued by the respondent and the

petitioners herein made application to the post of Junior Executive

(Airport-Operations). It is their case that the petitioners who performed

well in the written examination on September 2, 2012 were further

invited for an interview by the respondent and having appeared in the

interview, the respondent has failed to publish the final result to the said

post. The respondent merely published a public notice on its website

keeping the recruitment process relating to the said advertisement at

hold. They referred to the report of the committee constituted by the

Chairman wherein the committee recommended that the candidates who
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                              Page 24 of 96
 had appeared in the exam should be asked to take the exam once again.

The petitioners‟ case is that they tried all means possible through

telephonic calls and personal visit to gather when the respondent would

finally declare the result and finish its selection process. The petitioners

referred to the filing of the W.P.(C) No. 2204/2014. They referred to

their academic excellence. They are bona fide candidates who have

cleared the competitive exam conducted by the respondent on their own

merit.      The respondent has chosen a patently defective method by

comparing the petitioners against each other instead of comparing them

with all other candidates in a specific centre within Delhi or of all

candidates within the State of Delhi. The petitioner‟s case is, in some

cases where there is no other petitioner to compare with, a petitioner in a

particular question paper set, such petitioner has been compared with an

unsuccessful candidate showing the same number of common wrong

answers defeating the assertion of the respondent.     The candidates who

prepared for such competitive exams are trained to eliminate options in

multiple choice style questions and decide between probable two

options.       The candidates, thus, are bound to have common wrong

answers while attempting the same subject papers irrespective of the

question paper set as the questions in different sets are almost always the

same and are merely shuffle as a block. The alleged finding of the
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                    Page 25 of 96
 respondent that selection from Delhi Centre is disproportionately high

and as such impugns the selection process in the State is untenable as the

respondent failed to appreciate that the number of applicants from Delhi

centre are also disproportionately high. According to the petitioners, the

respondent also failed to note that apart from Allahabad, Delhi is the

only centre in the whole of North India and candidates from the said vast

region would have naturally preferred Delhi as a centre due to better

connectivity and accommodation facilities. According to the petitioners

they apprehend that through the unscientific and incompetent tools of

inquiry, the respondent would term the bona fide petitioners also as

tainted and further may also cancel the entire selection process citing it

as vitiated. They rely upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in the

case of Joginder Pal vs. State of Punjab 2014 6 SCC 644.

24.      This petition was filed on 20.8.2015 and the same listed before the

Court on 25.8.2015. As counter affidavit was already filed in W.P.(C)

No.2204/2014 and the issue being identical the learned counsel for the

respondent was directed to give copy of the counter affidavit filed in

W.P.(C) No. 2204/2014 to the learn counsel for the petitioner. I may

only state, here that the learned counsel for the respondent during the

course of submission had raised an issue of delay and laches with regard

to this case as well.
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                    Page 26 of 96
 Writ Petition No. 8110/2015

25.      This petition has been filed by three petitioners inter-alia seeking a

direction to the respondent to appoint petitioner No.1 & 2 to the post of

Junior Executive (Information Technology) and petitioner No.3 to the

post of Junior Executive (Engineering-Civil) with a further direction to

the respondent to investigate the credentials of the petitioners based on

the principles elucidated in Joginder Pal vs. State of Punjab 2014 6

SCC 644. It is the case of the petitioners that they are the provisional

appointees to the post of Junior Executive (Information Technology) and

Junior Executive (Engineering-Civil) and despite lapse of two years,

they have not been issued any appointment letters. They referred to the

number of vacancies advertised to the said posts. They also referred to

the fact that they appeared in the written exam conducted by the

respondent on August 26, 2012 and having been invited for interview,

they having successfully cleared the interview stage and found to be

suitably selected provisionally to the post, the respondents have failed to

appoint them. They also referred to the decision of the respondent to

keep in abeyance the recruitment process.          They also challenged the

unscientific method of inquiry evolved by the respondent to separate the

tainted candidates from the untainted candidates on similar lines as has

been challenged by the writ petitioners in W.P.(C) No. 8098/2015
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                       Page 27 of 96
 (Prateek Singh and others vs. Airports Authority of India). The said

grounds have already been set out above under the heading W.P.(C)

No.8098/2015 and hence are not repeated again. The respondent has

urged the plea of delay and laches in this case also.

Submissions:-

26.      Ms. Jyoti Singh, learned Senior Counsel appearing for writ

petitioners in W.P.(C) No. 2204/2014, would draw my attention to

various notings as annexed by the respondent with its counter affidavit to

contend that the investigation by the Directorate Vigilance was with

regard to the recruitment to the post of Junior Executive (Information

Technology) and it was in that regard, files were sent to the Vigilance

Department by the H.R as is clear from the pages 139 to 147 of the paper

book. In other words, it is her case that the recruitment to the post of

Junior      Executive         (Engineering-Electrical)   and   Junior    Executive

(Engineering-Civil) was nowhere an issue. Even otherwise it is her

submission, that the opinion of the committee that the written

examination should be conducted once again is untenable and could not

have given such recommendation/direction without going into the

irregularities.       She would also state, the decision of the competent

authority to scrap the entire recruitment process pursuant to

advertisement No.02/2012 and issue fresh advertisement for the
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                          Page 28 of 96
 vacancies advertised vide the said advertisement inviting fresh

applications in general and to allow all the candidates who had applied

earlier by giving age relaxation as well as fee relaxation also untenable.

According to her, the reasons given by the respondent for taking decision

dated November 19, 2014 at page 253 of the paper book does not reflect

any wrong doing on the part of the petitioners herein and could not have

affected their selection. She would also draw the attention of this Court

to the affidavit dated January 21, 2015 filed by the respondent and

contest the findings of the Vigilance Directorate to be with regard to

Information Technology and any conclusion therein could not be

considered as irregularity with regard to the other streams. She has

referred to the various paras of the report of the vigilance directorate i.e

paras No. 5.4.2, 5.1.1, 5.1.3, para 6, para 8 etc. She also contended that

the affidavit filed by the respondent on August 5, 2015 which was

primarily based on inquiry into conduct of the exams more specifically

whether there was any irregularity with respect to the petitioners, she

would state that the conclusion of the respondent against the petitioners

was on an inference rather than on a conclusive proof. She would state,

that it is only when the respondent could separate the „chaff‟ from „grain‟

insofar as the selection of the petitioners, can the respondent deny the

appointment to the petitioners. According to her, the petitioners are
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                    Page 29 of 96
 untainted and had qualified by virtue of their merit and not because of

any      cheating,         fraud       etc.     She   had    also   challenged        the

discrepancy/illegality noticed by the respondent in their investigation

pursuant to the orders of this Court dated January 22, 2015 and May 1,

2015.      She also states, the finding of the Vigilance Directorate on

procedural irregularity of the Hall tickets could not be downloaded,

cannot be imputed, to the agency, as the same were sent to the candidates

by the H.R. department of the respondent. Similarly, the syllabus of the

written examination was to be prescribed by the respondent and not the

agency. She also states, the invigilation was done by the respondent and

even if a casual report was given by the observers of respondent then the

agency cannot be blamed.                    She states, the primary ground, that the

selected candidates were from the Delhi Centre especially from a

particular State, cannot be a ground to justify the cancellation, as the

Delhi centre consists of 11 States of North India having big coaching

centres, it is but natural that the applications were more as compared to

the other centres and accordingly the success rate was more in the

written examination, so also in the interview and final result. She casts a

doubt on the inquiry conducted by the vigilance directorate in the

absence of the answer sheets. She also states instances of Naveen and

Manu Yadav given by the respondent shows non application of mind
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                             Page 30 of 96
 inasmuch as, Naveen appeared in Electrical exam and not in Airport

Operations. Similarly, Manu Yadav appeared in I.T and not in Airport

Operations. She has placed before me, the communications evidencing

the same. She states, everything was in the realm of suspicion and

nothing more, which would not justify cancellation.

27.      Mr. Rahul Sharma, learned counsel appearing for the writ

petitioner in W.P.(C) No.4597/2014 would also submit that there is no

evidence with the respondents to show any wrong doing on the part of

the petitioners. The impugned action of the respondent has caused grave

prejudice to the service career and future prospects of the petitioners.

The impugned action breeds, frustration in the petitioners and many of

them have crossed the maximum age limit. He states that in view of the

settled position of law that the respondents in a case of this nature need

to separate the grain & chaff, and having not done that, cannot take any

action against the petitioners as the same would be violative of Article

14, 16 & 21 of the Constitution of India.

28.      Mr. Upendra Pratap Singh, learned counsel appearing for the

petitioners in W.P. (C) Nos. 4279/2015 and 6129/2015, makes similar

submissions as made by Ms. Jyoti Singh and Mr. Rahul Sharma. He

states, there is no factual foundation about the irregularities having been

committed by the petitioners.               He also state, there is no evidence
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                         Page 31 of 96
 showing any connivance between the recruiting agency and the

petitioners herein.

29.      Mr.Manoj V. George, learned counsel appearing in two petitions,

would submit that the petitioners are highly qualified, in one case he is

First Class B.Tech with M.B.A. They are 27 years of age and having a

whole carrier before them and such serious charges have a demoralising

effect on them.             He would also state, that persons from Madras,

Telangana, Delhi and U.P have also been selected, which clearly

demonstrates that the plea of the respondents that the maximum number

of people selected being from Delhi region that too all the candidates

who are from Haryana or acquired the qualification from Haryana, is

totally baseless allegation. Merely because the maximum number of

candidates are from Haryana or having acquired qualification from

Haryana, would not reveal that the examination process is marred by

irregularities on the part of the candidates or on the part of the agency.

He states, that Delhi is a big region with many centres. It is not a case

where the selection has been effected only through one singular process

but is through a three tier process, where the irregularities cannot be

committed. Even the show-cause notices, which were issued, have been

replied to. He would contest the plea of delay, taken by learned counsel

for the respondents by relying upon the judgment of the Kerala High
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                    Page 32 of 96
 Court in the case of Antony, P.A. and Ors vs. Krishnadas, M.N. and

Ors. He would seek the dismissal of the writ petition. The learned

counsel for the petitioners together rely on the following judgments in

support of this submissions:-

30.      On the other hand, Mr. Sanjay Jain, learned Additional Solicitor

General, has taken me through the counter affidavit filed by the

respondent with regard to the number of posts advertised and the process

evolved for making selection.               He would state, when the list of

successful candidates for the post of Junior Executive (Information

Technology) was submitted by the H.R cell to the Chairman for

approval, the Chairman got suspicious as to why most of the candidates

i.e 80% approximately were selected from Delhi/Haryana and hence

informed the Vigilance Directorate which carried out the investigation.

The Vigilance Directorate made detailed investigation with respect to the

examination conducted to the post of Junior Executive (Information

Technology) and submitted their initial finding indicating various

irregularities observed by them.               It is his submission that the

irregularities observed by the Directorate are not only discrepancy

related to procedural and monitoring but are related to criminal

misconduct for manipulating the written examination. The Directorate

also recommended that there is no requirement to wait for consolidated

report for all other disciplines/cadres which were advertised.                 The

findings of one discipline constitutes sufficient ground for sending the


W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                      Page 34 of 96
 whole matter to the CBI. He would state that the CBI had not taken up

the case which was of the view that the matter must be looked into by the

Crime Branch, Delhi Police. According to him, the Crime Branch is

investigating the whole case.               He would submit, that if the recruitment

process is flawed then the petitioners should not get advantage of the

same. According to him, the recruitment process was outsourced to a

private organization and the investigation carried out by the Vigilance

Directorate and the subsequent inquiry carried out in terms of the order

of this Court, prima facie it appears the process has been manipulated as

it is noted that those candidates who appeared in Delhi have been

successful. He would draw my attention to affidavit dated January 21,

2015 to contend that the total number of applicants is the highest in

Delhi, the candidates appeared in the written test was 49.94% and the

presence of the candidates in first hundred as per written test was 94%

and the total number of candidates called for interview was 78.11% in

Junior Executive (Airport-Operations). He would also state, similar is

the position in other streams inasmuch as in Junior Executive

(Engineering-Civil), the total number of applicants from Delhi were

33.9%; candidates appeared in the written test were 43.67%, presence of

candidates in first hundred as per written test was 73% and number of

candidates called for interview were 79.45%. He has made reference to
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                             Page 35 of 96
 the preliminary report of the Vigilance Directorate and had taken me

through the same from page 377 onwards and drew my attention to the

conclusion of the Vigilance Directorate.       He would state, that the

conclusion arrived at by the Vigilance Directorate is a possibility and the

respondent corporation is taking action. There is a cogent material for the

respondent to take a decision. The exam conducted could not be trusted

at all. He also stated the manner in which the agency was appointed by

the H.R bypassing the procedure and it is the requirement of public

interest that recruitment to the public authority, which is performing the

critical function should be on merit.       He states that none of the

petitioners have been debarred from applying fresh recruitment process.

There is no mala fide in the impugned action. The principle of grain and

chaff can be invoked if it is possible. There is no stigma attached to any

of the petitioners. The test of reasonableness has been met. He would

rely upon the following judgments:-

        SCC 47

        Punjab and Ors., (2006) 11 SCC 356

31.      Ms. Jyoti Singh, learned Senior Counsel, in her rejoinder would

state that the preliminary report was submitted after this Court had

passed an order on May 1, 2015. According to her, para 7 and 8 of the

additional affidavit, filed by the respondents on August 5, 2015, wherein

a reference was made to the answering pattern is totally baseless. The

pattern does not signify any wrong doing on the part of the

petitioners/the successful candidates. The roll number of the successful

candidates was not close to each other to even presume, they have

copied.       That apart, the attempt of the respondents to correlate the

common wrong answers of the successful candidates is misconceived

and overlooking the number of wrong answers which varies. In other

words, it is a coincidence that there are some questions (not all) whereby

answers were common. The candidates made an attempt as there was no

negative marking. She states, some of the petitioners have not attempted

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                  Page 37 of 96
 several questions as compared to some, who attempted some questions.

She also discount any wrong doing on the part of the petitioners as

during the written examination, the invigilation was done by the Airports

Authority of India. Even the examination/hall tickets were sent by the

Airports Authority of India to the candidates. In other words, the agency

had no role to play for sending the hall tickets or invigilations. If the

candidates had not downloaded the hall tickets, the agency was not at

fault. In fact, she raised doubt on the comparison of the answer sheets of

the candidates by stating, a show cause notice was issued to the agency

for destroying the same. According to her, everything is suspicious to

the respondents.

32.      Having considered the submissions made by learned counsel for

the parties, an issue of delay was raised by Mr. Sanjay Jain, Learned

ASG in W.P.(C) No.6129/2015 and 4279/2015, so also in W.P.(C)

No.8098/2015 and 8110/2015. In that regard, the plea taken by the

respondents in support of point of delay is as under:-

          "2. That the Airports Authority of India issued a notice
          on its website on 21.03.2014 and which was also
          published in leading newspapers on 24.03.2014 inviting
          attention of the candidates who had appeared in the
          written examination pursuant to advertisement No.
          02/2012 for the post of Manager / Junior Executive of
          various disciplines except Junior Executive (Fire
          Services) that it has been decided to re-do the entire
          selection process afresh for the above posts except Junior
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                    Page 38 of 96
           Executive (Fire Services) due to administrative reasons
          and also that the notified terms and conditions in the
          advertisement No. 02/2012 will remain same and the
          candidates who earlier appeared in the examination and
          subsequent process are required to appear again in the
          re-examination to be conducted and further that the date
          of written examination will be notified in due course of
          time on AAI's website.

          3. That a writ petition bearing No. 2204 of 2014 titled
          Mohit Panwar & Others Versus Airports Authority of
          India was filed and listed before the Court on 02.04.2014
          whereby similar relief as sought in the instant petition
          was sought by the Petitioners therein and by order dated
          02.04.2014, this Hon'ble Court while issuing notice in the
          said petition directed the Respondent therein i.e. Airports
          Authority of India to approach this Hon'ble Court before
          a firm date for fresh examination is, publicized. That
          thereafter another writ petition being W.P (C) No. 4597
          of 2014 titled Abhay Sharma and Others Versus Airports
          Authority of India was filed and listed before this Hon'ble
          Court on 24.07.2014, on which date this Hon'ble Court
          was informed regarding the pendency of W.P.(C). No.
          2204 of 2014 and also that pleadings in the said writ
          petition are complete. This Hon'ble Court vide the said
          order directed that W.P. (C) No. 4597 of 2014 be placed
          for hearing along with W.P. (C) No. 2204 of 2014.

          5. That vide order dated 25.07.2014 in W.P. (C) No.
          4597 of 2014, Counsel for the parties stated that they
          shall rely on the pleadings in W.P. (C) No. 2204 of
          2014 for the purpose of addressing arguments as
          pleadings were complete in W.P. (C) No. 2204 of
          2014.

          6. That thereafter arguments commenced in W.P. (C)
         No. 2204 of 2014 and W.P.(C) No. 4597 of 2014 on
         25.07.2014 which continued till 17.12.2014 and was to
         conclude on the said day, however, on 17.12.2014, the
         Lawyers abstained from work and the Petition was
         adjourned to 08.01.2015. In January, 2015, there was
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                     Page 39 of 96
          a change in the Roster Bench and the said petition
         was listed before another Hon'ble Judge of this
          Hon'ble Court. Even before the said Court the matter
         was argued since January, 2015 itself.

          7. The petitioners herein were fully aware regarding
          the notification dated 21.03.2014, however, instead of
          approaching this Hon'ble Court the said Petitioners
          were fence sitting and awaiting the outcome of W.P.(C)
          No. 2204 of 2014, when much water had already flown
          inasmuch as vide order dated 22.01.2015, this Hon'ble
          Court directed that the Airports Authority of India can
          continue with fresh selection process for appointment
          to other posts than to which the Petitioners are
          contenders.

          8. That the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of Orissa
          Versus Mamata Mohanty reported as (2011) 3 SCC
          436 has clearly held that section 3 of the Limitation
          Act, 1963, makes its obligatory on the part of the
          Court to dismiss the suit or appeal if made after the
          prescribed period even though the limitation is not set
          up as a defence and there is no plea to raise the issue
          of limitation even at the Appellate stage because in
          some of the cases it may go to the root of the matter".

33.      The pleadings as made by the respondent aforesaid would only

reveal that the petitioners could have approached the Court earlier and

despite the knowledge, having not filed the petition at the appropriate

point of time, the petition must be dismissed. The reliance placed by Mr.

Jain on the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of State of Orissa

and another vs. Mamata Mohanty (2011) 3 SCC 436 wherein the facts

were that the respondent was appointed as a Lecturer in Niali College on

9.7.1979 and her appointment as such was approved by the Director of
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                     Page 40 of 96
 Higher Education, Orissa and was granted the benefit of receiving 1/3rd

grant-in-aid. Notification dated 6.10.1989 was issued for revising the

pay scale with effect from January 1, 1986. The said notification was

applicable only in such cases where post has been granted the benefit of

grant-in-aid scheme by 1.4.1989. The respondent did not make any

representation before any authority to get the benefit of the said

notification dated 6.10.1989. Rather, approached the High Court on

11.11.2005 by filing Writ Petition No.14157/2005 seeking a direction to

the State Government to pay the pre revised pay scale with effect from

January 1, 1986 placing reliance on the various orders of the High Court.

The State of Orissa contested the writ petition. The High Court placing

reliance on the earlier judgment allowed the writ petition giving the

benefit of the pay scale to her with effect from 1.6.1984. The High

Court has held in para 53 and 54 as under:-

          "53. Needless to say that Limitation Act 1963 does not
          apply in writ jurisdiction. However, the doctrine of
          limitation being based on public policy, the principles
          enshrined therein are applicable and writ petitions are
          dismissed at initial stage on the ground of delay and
          laches. In a case like at hand, getting a particular pay
          scale may give rise to a recurring cause of action. In such
          an eventuality, the petition may be dismissed on the
          ground of delay and laches and the court may refuse to
          grant relief for the initial period in case of an
          unexplained and inordinate delay. In the instant case, the
          respondent claimed the relief from 1.1.1986 by filing a
          petition on 11.11.2005 but the High Court for some
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                     Page 41 of 96
           unexplained reason granted the relief w.e.f. 1.6.1984,
          though even the Notification dated 6.10.1989 makes it
          applicable w.e.f. 1.1.1986.

          54. This Court has consistently rejected the contention
          that a petition should be considered ignoring the delay
          and laches in case the petitioner approaches the Court
          after coming to know of the relief granted by the Court in
          a similar case as the same cannot furnish a proper
          explanation for delay and laches. A litigant cannot wake
          up from deep slumber and claim impetus from the
          judgment in cases where some diligent person had
          approached the Court within a reasonable time. (See:
          M/s Rup Diamonds & Ors., v. Union of India & Ors., AIR
          1989 SC 674; State of Karnataka & Ors. v. S.M.
          Kotrayya & Ors., (1996) 6 SCC 267; and Jagdish Lal &
          Ors.v. State of Haryana & Ors., AIR 1997 SC 2366)."

34.      Insofar as the reliance placed by Mr. George on the judgment of

the Kerala High Court in the case of Antony P.A. and Ors vs.

Krishnadas, M.N. and Ors is concerned, the High Court has in para 21

and 22 has stated as under:-

          "21. First of all, we will deal with the delay aspects
          pointed out against the writ Petitions filed in the year
          2003. It has been specifically submitted on behalf of the
          writ Petitioner in W.P.(C) No.26486/2003 that though he
          contested for the selection, he was not fortunate to be
          included in the select list. He came to know about the
          discrepancies in the selection when he came across with
          the affidavit filed on 1.1.2003 in O.P. No.18462/2000
          with regard to the assigning of marks for additional
          qualification. Thereupon he attempted to get the details
          of the marks awarded to him from the University; but was
          not successful. It was int he above circumstances the writ
          Petition was happened to be filed in August, 2003
          impugning the selection process, whereby he had been
          excluded without giving additional marks and on the
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                    Page 42 of 96
           ground of less service left. Therefore, there was no delay.

          22. Of course, as pointed out by the Appellants, in the
          decision reported in Roshan Lal and Ors v. International
          Airport Authority of India and Ors. 1980 (supp.) S.C.C
          449, even two years delay in challenging the appointment
          had been found to be detrimental to the Petitioners. But
          when one incumbent has explained, to the possible extent,
          the reason for the delay in cases arising violation of the
          guaranteed rights under Article 16 of the Constitution,
          such explanation when found acceptable to a reasonable
          mind shall have to be considered, in the over all
          circumstances of the case. One important circumstance
          is that challenging the very same selection process and
          impugning the notification at the threshold, there had
          been at least two Writ Petitions filed in time. The person
          selected had already been thus facing the challenge
          against their selection at least in two Writ Petitions filed
          in time. In such circumstances, when another incumbent,
          with some more details, has come with an equal
          challenge offering explanation for delay, necessarily, as
          the matter involves the violation and infraction of the
          right guaranteed under Article 16 of the Constitution, the
          delay can be excused to entertain such writ Petitions.
          Therefore, the contention regarding delay is of no avail
          for the writ Appellants when they themselves were facing
          challenge against their appointments at least in two Writ
          Petitions filed in time. No special or added prejudice is,
          in any way, caused to them."

35. In the case in hand also, there is no denial to the fact that W.P.(C)

Nos.2204/2014, 4597/2014 have been filed in this Court challenging the

notification dated March 21, 2014. Even in the relevant paragraphs of

the counter-affidavit, which have been referred to above, the respondents

referred to the pendency of the W.P.(C) No.2204/2014 and the said

petition is part of the batch of the writ petitions, which are being decided
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                      Page 43 of 96
 by this order. Noting the fact that the writ petition has not been decided

and also the similarity of the facts of the case in hand with the facts in

the judgment of the High Court, the reasons given by the petitioners in

the petition, which gives a plausible explanation for the delay in

approaching the Court, this Court is of the view that the delay and laches

would not come in the way for a decision on the merit of issue raised.

36.      On merits, the challenge in this batch of petitions is to the

notification dated March 21, 2014 whereby it was decided to redo the

entire selection process afresh for the post of Manager/Junior Executive

for the candidates who had earlier appeared in the examination in terms

of advertisement No. 02/2012.               During the pendency of the writ

petitions, the respondent had reviewed the impugned decision on

November 19, 2014 whereby it was decided to scrap the entire

recruitment process pursuant to advertisement No.02/2012 and issued

fresh advertisement for the vacancies advertised vide the said

advertisement inviting fresh applications in general and to allow all the

candidates who had applied earlier by giving age relaxation as well as

fee relaxation. Even though the decision has not been challenged as the

challenge in these petitions is to the notification dated March 21, 2014, I

deem it appropriate to consider the substantive prayer made in the

petition that too for a direction to the respondent to issue appointment
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                      Page 44 of 96
 letters to the petitioners who were found suitable and selected

provisionally for the post of Junior Executive.

37.      Before I embark to consider the submissions as made by the

learned counsel for the parties, a word on the orders passed by this Court

time to time in these petitions specifically in the lead case W.P.(C) No.

2204/2014. On April 2, 2014 when the writ petition was listed for the

first time, this court noting that fresh examination is confined only to

those who appeared in the examination held earlier directed the

respondents to approach the Court before a firm date for the fresh

examination is finalised.               On January 22, 2015, this Court, on the

submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioners that with

regard to 500 odd other posts, than to which the petitioners are

contenders, respondents can continue the fresh selection process for

appointment but with regard to the petitioners, the respondents should

examine the issue of "grain and chaff" i.e whether any irregularities can

be shown so far as the selection process of the petitioners is concerned,

only in such circumstance, the petitioners would not have any right

either for appointment or for drawing of a select list/merit list.

38.      On May 1, 2015, this Court had passed the following order:-

        "2. The aforesaid orders were passed in the light of the
        ratio of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of
        Joginder Pal and Others v State of Punjab and Others,
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                         Page 45 of 96
         (2014) 6 Supreme Court Cases 644 and which ratio is
        contained in paragraphs 10 to 10.5 of the judgment which
        read as under:-
        "10. From the reading of the judgment in Inderpreet Singh
        Kahlon case one can discern the following principles: 10.1
        An appointment made in violation of Articles 14 and 16 of
        the Constitution of India would be void. It would be a
        nullity. Since the services of the appellants were
        terminated not in terms of the Rules but in view of the
        commission of illegality in the selection process involved,
        the applicability of the relevant provisions of the statutes
        as also the effect of the provisions of the Article 311 of the
        Constitution need not be considered.
         10.2. Before a finding that an appointment has been made
        in violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution can
        be arrived at, the appointing authority must take into
        consideration the foundational facts. Only when such
        foundational facts are established, can the legal principles
        be applied. When the services of employees are terminated
        inter alia on the ground that they might have aided and
        abetted corruption and, thus, either for the sake of probity
        in governance or in public interest their services should be
        terminated, the court must satisfy itself that conditions
        therefor exist. The court while setting aside a selection
        may require the State to establish that the process was so
        tainted that the entire selection process is liable to be
        cancelled. In a case of this nature, thus, the question which
        requires serious consideration is as to whether due to the
        misdeed of some candidates, honest and meritorious
        candidates should also suffer.
        10.3. A distinction exists between a proven case of mass
        cheating for a board examination and an unproven
        imputed charge of corruption where the appointment of a
        civil servant is involved. Only in the event it is found to be
        impossible or highly improbable that the tainted cases can
        be separated from the non-tainted cases could en masse
        orders of termination be issued. Both the State
        Government as also the High Court in that view of the
        matter should have made all endeavours to segregate the
        tainted from the no-tainted candidates.

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                      Page 46 of 96
         10.4. Cases which may arise where the selection process is
        perceived to be tainted may be categorised in the following
        manner:
        (i) Cases where the "event" has been investigated.
        (ii) Cases where CBI inquiry took place and was
        completed or a preliminary investigation was concluded.
        (iii) Cases where the selection was made but appointment
        was not made.
        (iv) Cases where the candidates were also ineligible and
        the appointments were found to be contrary to law or
        rules.
        If the services of appointees who had put in a few years of
        service were terminated, compliance with three principles
        at the hands of the State was imperative viz. (1) to
        establish satisfaction in regard to the sufficiency of the
        materials collected so as to enable the State to arrive at its
        satisfaction that the selection process was tainted; (2) to
        determine the question that the illegalities committed went
        to the root of the matter, which vitiated the entire selection
        process. Such satisfaction as also the sufficiency of
        materials were required to be gathered by reason of a
        thorough investigation in a fair and transparent manner;
        (3) whether the sufficient material present enabled the
        State to arrive at a satisfaction that the officers in majority
        had been found to be part of the fraudulent purpose or the
        system itself was corrupt.
        10.5. Once the necessary factual findings as enumerated
        above are arrived at, or it is found impossible or highly
        improbable to separate tainted from untainted cases, all
        appointments traceable to the officers concerned could be
        cancelled. But admittedly, in the present case, although
        there had been serious imputations against Ravinderpal
        Singh Sidhu being at the helm of the affairs of the State
        Public Service Commission, all decisions made by the
        Commission during his tenure are yet to be set aside."
        (Underlining added)

        3. In law, therefore, either it is possible to separate tainted
        from the untainted candidates or it is not possible to
        separate them because of the type of infraction and
        resultantly the entire process may have to be scrapped. If,
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                       Page 47 of 96
         however, it is very much possible to separate the grain
        from the chaff i.eseparation of tainted candidates from the
        untainted candidates in a selection process which is not
        wholly vitiated, the selection process as a whole as per the
        case of Joginder Pal Singh (supra) cannot be scrapped.

        4. Today, the learned ASG appeared, and who is
        appearing for the first time, and after some arguments
        were heard, the position arising is that all that is being
        asked from the AAI/respondent is that it is bound to
        conduct an investigation as per the resources available
        with it with respect to the petitioners/candidates, the
        centres in which they appeared, the results of those
        centres, the answers given by the petitioners and other
        candidates of those centres and every other material
        aspect which is possible to be investigated in order to
        know whether at all there can be a separation of the
        tainted from the untainted candidates and whether
        therefore petitioners are untainted candidates who must
        get selection?

        5. Of course, if the malaise is such that it is not possible to
        separate the tainted candidates from the untainted
        candidates, then obviously, may be a conclusion can be
        arrived at with respect to cancelling of the entire selection
        process, however, assumptions and presumptions can
        never be the answer when the issue is of an alleged taint of
        specific candidates i.e specific nature of the issue as to
        whether the candidates such as the petitioners are tainted
        or they are untainted and also the fact that the entire
        selection process cannot be found to be vitiated for its
        cancellation as a whole.
        6. Accordingly, learned ASG on instructions states that
        AAI/respondent will endeavour to conduct a specific
        inquiry and investigation as to whether there can be
        separation of the tainted from the untainted candidates in
        the facts of the present case with regard to the subject
        examination conducted with respect to the posts of Junior
        Executive (Engineer-Electrical) and Junior Executive
        (Engineer-Civil) and Junior Engineer (Information
        Technology), 2012 Examination."
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                       Page 48 of 96
 39.      Pursuant to the aforesaid order, the respondent had carried out the

exercise and filed a report by way of an additional affidavit. Suffice to

state, regrettably the petitioners have not chosen to file a response to

such an important affidavit. Even though the order dated May 1, 2015

refers to the judgment of the Supreme Court in Joginder Pal and others

vs. State of Punjab and others (2014) 6 SCC 644, for a better

perspective that too on the basis of the judgments referred to, by the

counsel for the parties, the position of law in matters of this nature as

enunciated by the Supreme Court in Inderpreet Singh Kahlon and

others vs. State of Punjab and ors (2006) 11 SCC 356, is well settled,

wherein the Supreme Court had referred to its earlier judgments, and in

paras 46 to 59 has noted as under:-

        46.    A distinction moreoever exists between a proven
        case of mass cheating for a board examination and an
        unproven imputed charge of corruption where the
        appointment of a civil servant is involved.
        47. In Bihar School Examination Board v. Subhash
        Chandra Sinha and Others [(1970) 1 SCC 648], the court
        came to a finding that the high percentage of marks
        obtained by the candidates who appeared at the selection
        of the centre in question did give rise to a suspicion that
        unfair means had been practised and the Board was
        justified in investigating the case. While the High Court
        held that despite the same, the principles of natural
        justice was required to be complied with; this Court
        noticed the reports of the experts and came to the
        conclusion that the results thereof speaks for themselves.

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                    Page 49 of 96
         It was noticed that whereas in other centers the average
        of successful candidates was 50%, in the center in
        question, the percentage of passing in different papers
        were unusually high ranging from 70% to 100%. In that
        view of the matter, this Court held:
        "12. These figures speak for themselves. However, to
        satisfy ourselves we ordered that some answer books be
        brought for our inspection and many such were
        produced. A comparison of the answer books showed
        such a remarkable agreement in the answers that no
        doubt was left in our minds that the students had
        assistance from an outside source. Therefore the
        conclusion that unfair means were adopted stands
        completely vindicated.
        13. This is not a case of any particular individual who is
        being charged with adoption of unfair means but of the
        conduct of all the examinees or at least a vast majority of
        them at a particular centre. If it is not a question of
        charging any one individually with unfair means but to
        condemn the examination as ineffective for the purpose it
        was held. Must the Board give an opportunity to all the
        candidates to represent their cases? We think not. It was
        not necessary for the Board to give an opportunity to the
        candidates if the examinations as a whole were being
        cancelled. The Board had not charged any one with
        unfair means so that he could claim to defend himself.
        The examination was vitiated by adoption of unfair means
        on a mass scale. In these circumstances it would be
        wrong to insist that the Board must hold a detailed
        inquiry into the matter and examine each individual case
        to satisfy itself which of the candidates had not adopted
        unfair means. The examination as a whole had to go."
        Such is not the case here.
        48. In Anamica Mishra and Others v. U.P. Public Service
        Commission, Allahabad and Others [1990 (Supp) SCC
        692], an error was found out at the stage of calling
        candidates for interview. This Court opined that as no
        defect was pointed out in regard to the written

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                    Page 50 of 96
         examination and the sole objection was confined to the
        exclusion of a group of successful candidates in interview
        there was no justification for cancelling the written part
        of the recruitment examination and the situation could
        have been appropriately met by setting aside the
        recruitment and asking for fresh interview of all eligible
        candidates on the basis of the written examination.
        49. Yet again in S.P. Biswas and Others v. State Bank of
        India [1991 Supp (2) SCC 354], the court refused to
        interfere with the result of the examination as it was
        shown that there had been neither any mass copying nor
        the final result was shown to have been influenced by the
        unfair means by any candidate.
        50. In those cases also tainted cases were separated from
        the non-tainted cases. Only, thus, in the event it is found
        to be an impossible or highly improbable, en masse
        orders of termination could have been issued.
        51. Both the State Government as also the High Court in
        that view of the matter should have made all endeavours
        to segregate the tainted from the non-tainted candidates.
        52. We may, at this stage, notice that the following cases
        would fall in the different categories which are
        enumerated hereinbelow:
        (i) Cases where the 'event' has been investigated:
        (a) Union Territory of Chandigarh v. Dilbagh Singh,
        (1993) 1 SCC 154 at paragraphs 3 and 7.
        (b) Krishan Yadav v. State of Haryana, (1994) 4 SCC 165
        at paragraphs 12, 15 and 22.
        (c) Union of India v. Anand Kumar Pandey, (1994) 5
        SCC 663 at paragraph 4.
        (d) Hanuman Prasad v. Union of India, (1996) 10 SCC
        742 at paragraph 4.
        (e) Union of India v. O. Chakradhar, (2002) 3 SCC 146
        at paragraph 9.

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                    Page 51 of 96
         (f) B. Ramanjini v. State of A.P., (2002) 5 SCC 533 at
        paragraph 4.
        (ii) Cases where CBI inquiry took place and was
        completed or a preliminary investigation was concluded:
        (a) O. Chakradhar (supra)
        (b) Krishan Yadav (supra)
        (c) Hanuman Prasad (supra)
        (iii) Cases where the selection was made but appointment
        was not made:
        (a) Dilbagh Singh (supra) at paragraph 3
        (b) Pritpal Singh v. State of Haryana, (1994) 5 SCC 695
        (c) Anand Kumar Pandey (supra) at paragraph 4.
        (d) Hanuman Prasad (supra)
        (e) B. Ramanjini (supra) at paragraph 4.
        (iv) Cases where the candidates were also ineligible and
        the appointments were found to be contrary to law or
        rules:
        (a) Krishan Yadav (supra)
        (b) Pramod Lahudas v. State of Maharashtra, (1996) 10
        SCC 749 wherein appointments had been made without
        following the selection procedure.
        (c) O. Chakradhar (supra) wherein appointments had
        been made without type-writing tests and other
        procedures of selection having not been followed.
        53. It is now well-settled that a decision is an authority
        for what it decides and not what can logically be deduced
        therefrom. It is also well settled that a ratio of case must
        be understood having regard to the fact situation
        obtaining therein. [See P.S. Sathappan (Dead) By LRs. v.
        Andhra Bank Ltd. and Others (2004) 11 SCC 672] M.P.
        Gopalakrishnan Nair v. State of Kerala, (2005) 11 SCC

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                     Page 52 of 96
         45 and Haryana State Coop. Land Development Bank v.
        Neelam, (2005) 5 SCC 91].
        54. In Benny T.D. and Others v. Registrar of Cooperative
        Societies and Another [(1998) 5 SCC 269], this Court
        repelled a contention raised therein that in view of the
        findings of the Public Inquiry Commission that there has
        been tampering of marks in respect of several candidates
        and as such there has been no fair and objective
        selection, public interest demanded annulment of the
        entire selection. This Court held that the same could not
        be done as the same would tantamount to gross violation
        of principles of natural justice which cannot be brushed
        aside on the ground that public interest demands
        annulment of the selection.
        55. Yet again in Onkar Lal Bajaj and Others v. Union of
        India and Another[(2003) 2 SCC 673], this Court while
        dealing with a case of en masse cancellation of the
        licences granted to the LPG Distributors as a result
        whereof unequals were said to have been clubbed by
        reason of arbitrary exercise of executive power, the same
        was held to be impermissible stating:
        "45. The solution by resorting to cancellation of all was
        worse than the problem. Cure was worse than the
        disease. Equal treatment to unequals is nothing but
        inequality. To put both the categories - tainted and the
        rest -on a par is wholly unjustified, arbitrary,
        unconstitutional being violative of Article 14 of the
        Constitution"
        It was further held:
        "46. The aforesaid observations would apply with equal if
        not more force to DSBs if media exposure that the
        allotments were made either to the high political
        functionaries themselves or their near and dear ones is
        correct, the authorities would not only be justified in
        examining such cases but it would be their duty to do so.
        Instead of fulfilling that duty and obligation, the executive
        cannot unjustly resort to cancellation of all the allotments

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                      Page 53 of 96
         en masse by treating unequals as equals without even
        prima facie examining any cases exposed by the media "
        This Court further observed:
        "35. The expression "public interest" or "probity in
        governance" cannot be put in a straitjacket. "Public
        interest" takes into its fold several factors. There cannot
        be any hard-and-fast rule to determine what is public
        interest. The circumstances in each case would determine
        whether government action was taken in public interest
        or was taken to uphold probity in governance.
        36. The role model for governance and decision taken
        thereof should manifest equity, fair play and justice. The
        cardinal principle of governance in a civilized society
        based on rule of law not only has to base on transparency
        but must create an impression that the decision-making
        was motivated on the consideration of probity. The
        Government has to rise above the nexus of vested
        interests and nepotism and eschew window-dressing. The
        act of governance has to withstand the test of
        judiciousness and impartiality and avoid arbitrary or
        capricious actions. Therefore, the principle of
        governance has to be tested on the touchstone of justice,
        equity and fair play and if the decision is not based on
        justice, equity and fair play and has taken into
        consideration other matters, though on the face of it, the
        decision may look legitimate but as a matter of fact, the
        reasons are not based on values but to achieve popular
        accolade, that decision cannot be allowed to operate."
        56. Yet again in Union of India and Others v. Rajesh
        P.U., Puthuvalnikathu and Another [(2003) 7 SCC 285],
        this Court observed:
        "Applying a unilaterally rigid and arbitrary standard to
        cancel the entirety of the selections despite the firm and
        positive information that except 31 of such selected
        candidates, no infirmity could be found with reference to
        others, is nothing but total disregard of relevancies and
        allowing to be carried away by irrelevancies, giving a

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                    Page 54 of 96
         complete go-by to contextual considerations throwing to
        the winds the principle of proportionality in going farther
        than what was strictly and reasonably to meet the
        situation. In short, the competent authority completely
        misdirected itself in taking such an extreme and
        unreasonable decision of cancelling the entire selections,
        wholly unwarranted and unnecessary even on the factual
        situation found too, and totally in excess of the nature
        and gravity of what was at stake, thereby virtually
        rendering such decision to be irrational."
        57. The High Court, therefore, cannot be said to be right
        in applying the principle of mass cheating cases in the
        instant case.
        58. Contention of Mr. Dwivedi, as noticed hereinbefore,
        centers around condemnation of selection and not of the
        candidate. But, when the services of the employees are
        terminated inter alia on the ground that they might have
        aided and abated corruption and, thus, either for the sake
        of probity in governance or in public interest their
        services should be terminated; the court must satisfy itself
        that conditions therefore exist. The court while setting
        aside a selection may require the State to establish that
        the process was so tainted that the entire selection
        process is liable to be cancelled. We, however, do not
        agree with the submission of Mr. Dhavan that the
        decision of the Commission was collegiate in nature as it
        is well known that one of the members of the Commission
        was biased, other members could also be influenced by
        him. [See Ajay Hasia and Others v. Khalid Mujib
        Sehravardi and Others, (1981) 1 SCC 722]
        59. In a case of this nature, thus, the question which
        requires serious consideration is as to whether due to
        misdeed of some candidates, honest and meritorious
        candidates should also suffer."

40.      In East Coast Railway and another (supra), the Supreme Court

dealing with a case relating to recruitment to the post of Chief Typist,

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                     Page 55 of 96
 wherein the Administration cancelled the typing test and fixed a even

date for fresh typing test. The Tribunal justified the cancellation and

issuance of a notification for a fresh test. The High Court in the appeal,

set aside the order of the Tribunal, in a writ petition by those candidates

who were successful in the first test.             The High Court directed the

petitioner to proceed with the selection process. The Supreme Court

referring to its earlier judgments has held as under:-

        "14. It is evident from the above that while no candidate
        acquires an indefeasible right to a post merely because he
        has appeared in the examination or even found a place in
        the select list, yet the State does not enjoy an unqualified
        prerogative to refuse an appointment in an arbitrary
        fashion or to disregard the merit of the candidates as
        reflected by the merit list prepared at the end of the
        selection process. The validity of the State's decision not to
        make an appointment is thus a matter which is not beyond
        judicial review before a competent Writ court. If any such
        decision is indeed found to be arbitrary, appropriate
        directions can be issued in the matter.

        XXXX               XXXX             XXXX     XXXX

        "28. That is not, however, the position in the instant
        case. The order of cancellation passed by the competent
        authority was not preceded even by a prima facie
        satisfaction about the correctness of the allegations made
        by the unsuccessful candidates leave alone an inquiry into
        the same. The minimum that was expected of the authority
        was a due and proper application of mind to the
        allegations made before it and formulation and recording
        of reasons in support of the view that the competent
        authority was taking.

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                        Page 56 of 96
         29. There may be cases where an enquiry may be called
        for into the allegations, but there may also be cases, where
        even on admitted facts or facts verified from record or an
        enquiry howsoever summary the same maybe, it is possible
        for the competent authority to take a decision, that there
        are good reasons for making the order which the authority
        eventually makes. But we find it difficult to sustain an
        order that is neither based on an enquiry nor even a prima
        facie view taken upon a due and proper application of
        mind to the relevant facts. Judged by that standard the
        order of cancellation passed by the competent authority
        falls short of the legal requirements and was rightly
        quashed by the High Court.
        30. We may hasten to add that while application of mind to
        the material available to the competent authority is an
        essential pre-requisite for the making of a valid order, that
        requirement should not be confused with the sufficiency of
        such material to support any such order. Whether or not
        the material placed before the competent authority was in
        the instant case sufficient to justify the decision taken by it,
        is not in issue before us. That aspect may have assumed
        importance only if the competent authority was shown to
        have applied its mind to whatever material was available
        to it before cancelling the examination. Since application
        of mind as a thresh-hold requirement for a valid order is
        conspicuous by its absence the question whether the
        decision was reasonable having regard to the material
        before the authority is rendered academic. Sufficiency or
        otherwise of the material and so also its admissibility to
        support a decision the validity whereof is being judicially
        reviewed may even otherwise depend upon the facts and
        circumstances of each case. No hard and fast rule can be
        formulated in that regard nor do we propose to do so in
        this case.
        31. So also whether the competent authority ought to have
        conducted an enquiry into or verification of the allegations
        before passing an order of cancellation is a matter that
        would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each
        case. It may often depend upon the nature, source and

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                       Page 57 of 96
         credibility of the material placed before the authority. It
        may also depend upon whether any such exercise is
        feasible having regard to the nature of the controversy, the
        constraints of time, effort and expense. But what is
        absolutely essential is that the authority making the order
        is alive to the material on the basis of which it purports to
        take a decision. It cannot act mechanically or under an
        impulse, for a writ court judicially reviewing any such
        order cannot countenance the exercise of power vested in
        a public authority except after due and proper application
        of mind. Any other view would amount to condoning a
        fraud upon such power which the authority exercising the
        same holds in trust only to be exercised for a legitimate
        purpose and along settled principles of administrative law.
        32. The next question then is whether the selection should
        be finalized on the basis of the test held earlier or the
        matter allowed to be re-examined by the authority in the
        context of the representation received by it. In our opinion
        the latter course would be more in tune with the demands
        of justice and fairness especially when a second test has
        been conducted in which all the in service candidates have
        appeared. The result of this examination/test has not,
        however, been declared so far apparently because of the
        pendency of these proceedings.
        33. If upon due and proper consideration of the
        representation received from the candidates who were
        unsuccessful in the first examination, the competent
        authority comes to the conclusion that the test earlier held
        suffered from any infirmity or did not give a fair
        opportunity to all the candidates, it shall be free to pass a
        fresh order cancelling the said examination after
        recording such a finding in which event the second test
        conducted under the directions of the Tribunal would
        become the basis for the selection process to be finalized in
        accordance with law. In case, however, the authority
        comes to the conclusion that the earlier test suffered from
        no procedural or other infirmity or did not cause any
        prejudice to any candidate, the second test/examination


W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                     Page 58 of 96
         shall stand cancelled and the process of selection finalized
        on the basis of the test held earlier."

41.      Similarly, in Joginder Pal and others (supra), the Supreme Court

after referring to its judgment in Inderpreet Singh Kahlon case (supra),

which has been reproduced above, has in paras 39 and 40 has held as

under:-

        "39. It becomes crystal clear that the concern of the Court
        was that for the misdeeds of some candidates, honest and
        meritorious candidates should not suffer. Therefore,
        endeavour should be made to segregate the tainted
        candidates from those who were without any stigma and
        had been selected because of their sheer merit and not on
        account of any illegal considerations. We would also like
        to reproduce some of the parts of the concurring judgment
        authored by Justice Dalveer Bhandari (as His Lordship
        then was) with the aforesaid message, eloquently and
        impeccably:
        118. Undoubtedly, in the selection process, there have
        been manipulations and irregularities at the behest of R.S.
        Sidhu, the then Chairman, Punjab Public Service
        Commission. On careful scrutiny of the facts and
        circumstances of the case, in my considered opinion, the
        High Court ought to have made a serious endeavour to
        segregate the tainted from the non-tainted candidates.
        Though the task was certainly difficult, but by no stretch of
        imagination, it was not an impossible task.
        xxx
        124. The High Court has not considered the case in the
        proper perspective. The consequences of en masse
        cancellation would carry a big stigma particularly on
        cancellation of the selections which took place because of
        serious charges of corruption. The question arises whether

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                     Page 59 of 96
         for the misdeeds of some candidates, honest and good
        candidates should also suffer on en masse cancellation
        leading to termination of their services? Should those
        honest candidates be compelled to suffer without there
        being any fault on their part just because the Respondents
        find it difficult to segregate the cases of tainted candidates
        from the other candidates? The task may be difficult for the
        Respondents, but in my considered view, in the interest of
        all concerned and particularly in the interest of honest
        candidates, the State must undertake this task. The
        unscrupulous candidates should not be allowed to damage
        the entire system in such a manner where innocent people
        also suffer great ignominy and stigma.
        125. This Court had an occasion to examine a similar
        controversy in the case of Onkar Lal Bajaj's case (supra).
        In that case, there were serious allegations of political
        patronage in allotment of retail outlets of petroleum
        products, (LPG distributorships and SKO-LDO
        dealerships). This Court laid down that how could a large
        number of candidates against whom there was not even
        insinuation be clubbed with handful of those who were
        said to have been allotted dealerships/distributorships on
        account of political connection and patronage? This Court
        clearly stated that the two were clearly unequals. Equal
        treatment to unequals is nothing but inequality. This is the
        most important principle which has been laid down in this
        case by this Court. The Court further observed that to put
        both the categories, tainted and the rest, on par is wholly
        unjustified, arbitrary and unconstitutional, being violative
        of Article 14 of the Constitution. In somewhat similar
        circumstances, in this case, the Government, instead of
        discharging its obligation, unjustly resorted to the
        cancellation of all the allotments en masse by treating
        unequals as equals without even prima facie examining
        their cases. Those officers whose services were affected
        because of en masse cancellation have not been given an
        opportunity to represent before the concerned authorities.
        In the case of Onkar Lal Bajaj there were 413 cases and
        the task was indeed difficult to segregate the cases of
        political connection and patronage with other cases. But,

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                      Page 60 of 96
          even then, this Court while, setting aside the order of the
         Government cancelling the allotment, appointed a
         Committee of two retired Judges, one of this Court and
         another from the Delhi High Court, and they were
         requested to examine all 413 cases and decide the matter
         after getting the report from that Committee appointed by
         the Court.
         40. In view of the above, the issue of entire selection
         process having been vitiated would have arisen only if the
         findings of the Committee were that it was not possible to
         distinguish the cases of tainted from the non-tainted ones
         and there was a possibility that all of them would have got
         the benefit of wrong doings of Mr. Sidhu and his
         accomplices. Fortunately for these Appellants, it is not so
         as they have been found innocent. The Appellants get
         ensconced, earning a safe place, once they are removed
         from the category of nefarious persons. Though the tainted
         candidates have rightly received their comeuppance, but
         the innocent persons cannot be punished with them. Thus,
         it is difficult to accept the fallibility conclusion of the High
         Court."

42.      From a reading of the above judgments of the Supreme Court, the

following position emerges:

      (1) A distinction exists between a proven case of mass cheating and

         an unproven charge of corruption.

      (2) When a high percentage of marks obtained by the candidates who

         appeared in the selection in a centre in question did give rise to a

         suspicion that unfair means had been practiced.

      (3) If the examination has been vitiated by adoption of unfair means

         on a mass a scale, it would be wrong to insist that a detailed

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                        Page 61 of 96
          enquiry into the matter and examine each individual case to satisfy

         itself, which of the candidates had not adopted unfair means.

    (4) Where there is no mass copying nor the final result was shown to

         have been influenced by the unfair means by any candidate, such

         result should not be interfered with.

    (5) Efforts must be made to segregate the tainted from the non-tainted

         candidates but it is only in the event if it            is found      to be

         impossible         or    highly    improbable,   en   masse   orders      of

         termination/cancellation could be issued.

    (6) To put both the categories of tainted and non-tainted on par is

         wholly unjustified, arbitrary, unconstitutional being violative of

         Article 14 of the Constitution of India.

    (7) The Court while setting aside the selection process, may require

         the State to establish that the process was so tainted that the entire

         selection process is liable to be cancelled.

    (8) No candidate acquire an indefeasible right to a post merely

         because he has appeared in the examination or even found a place

         in the select list, yet, the State does not enjoy an unqualified

         prerogative to refuse an appointment in an arbitrary fashion.

    (9) The decision of the Authority or the State must precede by a prima

         facie satisfaction about the correctness of the allegations and
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                          Page 62 of 96
          formulation and recording of reasons in support of the view that

         the competent authority was taking.

      (10)        The decision of the competent authority can be based on

         admitted facts or facts verified from records or an enquiry

         howsoever summary may be, but, an order, neither based on

         enquiry nor a prima facie view is unsustainable.

      (11)        Sufficiency or relevancy of material would not be gone into,

         unless it is so perverse that such a decision cannot be arrived at.

43.      It is the case of the respondents, that they rely upon preliminary

report by the Directorate of Vigilance, report of the Committee and at

best the preliminary report of the enquiry or investigation pursuant to the

orders passed by this Court, which can be considered as an additional

evidence, which substantiates the preliminary report of the Directorate of

Vigilance in support of their decision to cancel the selection process.

41. In the preliminary report of the Directorate of Vigilance, which

looked into the procedure adopted for the recruitment for the post of

Junior Executive (I.T) from different aspects including advertisement,

application process, written examination, interview, result, OMR sheets

of the candidates called for the interview, test booklet/answer keys.

With regard to written examination, some of the observations in the

preliminary report are as under:-
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                       Page 63 of 96
         "4.2.3 It is apparent from the agency‟s inability in
        adopting 9/10 digit roll numbers that the agency was
        already having pre-printed Test booklets/OMR sheets in
        advance before conducting the exam for advertisement
        no.02/2012. This is against the spirit of fair and
        transparent conduct of exams.

        4.2.4 The emails to the candidates requesting to download
        the hall ticket were not sent before commencement of the
        written test on 26.08.12. Also it was not checked that how
        many candidates had downloaded their hall tickets. This
        casual approach might have led to lower percentage
        (19%) of candidates turning up for the written exam.

        4.2.5 The half ticket issued by the Dte. Of HR to the
        candidates was not having their scanned photographs and
        signatures uploaded at the time of application for
        matching the same during the written examination
        conducted by the agency. The details of the online
        recruitment applicants were forwarded by Directorate of
        HR to the agency in excel format does not include the
        scanned copy of photograph/ digital or scanned signature
        of the candidate. Therefore the signature and photographs
        of the candidates were not verified during/after the written
        exams. This creates opportunity for proxy sittings in the
        exam.

        4.2.6 It has been observed that the observer have given
        their report in a tailor made form i.e Total No. of
        Candidates and their attendance at the specific center.
        However, no specific reports/Comments in the form of
        general administration i.e any doubt about the
        question/copying or leakage of exam or any specific
        complaint made by the Candidate at the particular center
        was not given. However, Directorate of HR sought the
        report through RED/APD on conduct of the examination
        which has not been submitted by most of the center
        observers.

        4.2.7. The agency vide their letter dt. 19.09.12 submitted
        the result of written test to GM (HR) which was held on
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                    Page 64 of 96
         26.08.12 for the post of JE (IT). After receipt of the result
        from the agency the result was uploaded on AAI website on
        16.10.12.    However, it has been observed that no
        crosscheck or re-verification of the result viz-a-viz marks
        obtained by the successful candidates has been done byt he
        HR as a confirmation.

        4.2.8. It has been observed that after receiving the
        applications online, all the other activities were done
        manually or through M/s CPR. This is not in spirit of
        online recruitment systems.

        4.2.9 There is a scope for unscrupulous candidates to run
        away with the question paper in the beginning of exam or
        adopt other sophisticated electronic gadgets to copy ad
        leak the paper which can be solved and passed on to the
        candidates sitting in the examination center since there is
        no preliminary screening of candidates.

        4.2.10.      There was no syllabus provided to the
        agency/candidates for written examination. The pattern of
        examination was provided to the agency/candidates in the
        name of the syllabus"

44.      Similarly, under the heading "Result" the following were the

observations of the Directorate of Vigilance:-

        "6.2.1 Following has been observed from the list of
        selected candidates:
        6.2.1.1      11 out of 11 General candidates, 4 out of 5
        OBC candidates, 2 out of 3 SC candidates and 1 out of 1
        ST candidate selected from the post are from Delhi Region.
        Out of 20 candidates selected 14 candidates are either
        from Haryana state or have obtained their qualifying
        degree from this state.

        6.2.1.2     The candidates of Delhi region mostly
        belonging to the Haryana or studied there have scored up
        to 20% higher marks in the written exam in their
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                     Page 65 of 96
         respective categories compared to any other state/region.

        6.2.1.3     6 out of 11 general candidates, 3 out of 5
        OBC candidates were selected due to higher written marks
        and scored lower marks in interview.

        6.2.1.4      Out of the 11 selected general candidates 7
        candidates have secured less than 70 percentages of marks
        in their qualifying degree, out of which 6 candidates had
        65% marks or below in their qualifying degree.

        6.2.1.5     Out of 5 OBC candidates selected for the post
        3 were having 63% or lesser marks in their qualifying
        degree but scored very high marks in written exams and
        lower marks in the interview.

        6.2.1.6     Out of 20 successful candidates 8 candidates
        are from Maharshi Dayanand University and 3 candidates
        are from Kurushetra University.

        6.2.2.       Following has been observed from the list of
        unsuccessful candidates:

        6.2.2.1     The 12 out of 14 unsuccessful general
        candidates have secured marks in written exams ranging
        from 73 to 76. All these candidates were a good mix of all
        India students. Among these 12 unsuccessful general
        candidates 3 were having more than 80% of marks, 7 were
        having more than 75% marks and 2 were having more
        than 70% marks in their qualifying degrees.

        6.2.2.2      The remaining two general candidates
        belonging to the Haryana scored very high marks in
        written exam but could not be selected as one candidate
        scored very low marks (5) in interview and the other
        candidate did not attend the interview. Both these
        candidates have secured less than 70% marks in their
        qualifying degree.

        6.2.2.3   Similarly 2 OBC candidates belonging to the
        Haryana or studied there scored very high marks in
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                   Page 66 of 96
         written exam but could not be selected as 1 OBC candidate
        scored very low marks (4) in interview and the other
        candidate did not attend the interview. Both these
        candidates have secured less than 70% marks in their
        qualifying degree.

        6.2.2.4     The only unsuccessful SC candidate
        belonging to the Haryana or studied there scored highest
        marks in SC category, but could not be selected due to very
        poor marks in the interview (11). The candidate has
        secured 72% marks in the qualifying degree.

        6.2.2.5      The presence of the candidates of Haryana
        region or having qualifying degree from Haryana in the
        list of unsuccessful candidates is very low i.e only 5
        candidates out of 36 and are mentioned in Para 6.2.2.2,
        6.2.2.3 and 6.2.2.4 of the report. These 5 candidates have
        scored up to 20% more marks than other candidates in
        their respective categories but were not selected due to
        very poor marks in interview or being absent. These
        candidates could have been selected if they had scored
        even 50% marks in the interview.

        6.2.3 Majority of the general candidates finally selected
        for the posts appears to be predetermined candidates by
        virtue of their high scores in written examination. The
        analysis of the results indicates that the marks of the
        written examination are manipulated to favour a set of
        candidates mostly belonging to Haryana state or studied
        there. These candidates are otherwise not academically
        sound and does not appear suitable for the post
        considering their credentials and scores in interview.

        6.2.4 The five OBC candidates who have scored high
        marks in written examination for the five vacancies in
        OBC category also appears to be predetermined. This is
        not in line with the all India trend of scores which strongly
        suggest manipulation in written exam. However, two of
        them could not make it to final selection as one of the
        candidate scored only 4 marks in interview and one
        candidate could not attend the interview.
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                     Page 67 of 96
         6.2.5. One of the SC candidates who have scored high
        marks in written exam for three vacancies in SC category
        also appears predetermined. However this candidate
        could not make it to final selection besides scoring higher
        marks in the written exam among SC candidates due to
        poor score in interview.

        6.2.6. The candidates who have secured bare minimum of
        5 to 10 marks out of 30 in the interview are also coming in
        the merit list for giving offer of appointment due to their
        higher percentage in the written test which is having
        weightage of 80%. However, no action was taken in this
        regard by department of HR.

        6.2.7. The random checking of written test marks obtained
        by the candidates appeared for the interview was carried
        out by the team and it is observed that marks of one of the
        candidate Ms. Mona Taneja (Roll No.110487) comes to
        103 where as the marks obtained has been shown as 101 in
        the results provided by M/s CPR. This creates doubt over
        validity of the results.

        6.2.8 The majority of candidates selected are from Delhi
        Region in which Haryana state also falls. The Region-wise
        numbers of candidates who applied for the post and
        subsequently appeared for written test are as under which
        shows that 44% candidates appeared for written test are
        from Delhi Region. However, in the final selection is 90%
        candidates are from Delhi Region.

following are the observations:-

        "7.2.1        Following has been observed while analyzing
        the OMR sheets used for the written examination:
        i.     In the column of OMR sheets name, roll No., booklet
        series and Test Form No. etc., has been filled by the
        candidates in ink or pencil as per their desire, no clear cut
        instructions is given against these columns.
        ii.    The OMR sheet does not indicate the post code, date
        of examination etc.
        iii.   The OMR sheets supplied were not having Serial
        Nos.

        7.2.2 It has been observed that Dte. Of HR has not
        ensured the following before/after conducting the exam:
        a.     Vetting of the answers keys from third independent
        agency.
        b.     Checking of sample test booklets/sample OMR
        sheets.
        c.     Reconciliation of final result with the OMR sheet.

        7.2.3 The marking of the answers in the OMR sheet is
        done by the candidates by darkening the circles with HB
        pencils, which can be tempered/altered with in absence of
        proper checks like obtaining a photocopy of the OMR
        sheets at the exam centers by AAI observers.

        7.2.4 The table for „A‟ series booklet shows that the

        have scored higher marks in written exam have marked
        same options for the 10 wrong questions in this test
        booklet. It appears that these candidates were supplied
        with answer keys wherein some answers were deliberately
        marked wrong, probably to control the scoring of marks in
        the written examination. An extract of the table in respect
        of these candidates is as below:

        It is evident from the table that all the test booklet series
        are mathematically related and answers in different series
        can easily be computed with a single key.

        7.2.9. On the basis of the above relationship comparison
        of the options of the same wrong questions among different
        series was carried out and the same tabulated below:

        The table shows that the candidates belonging to Haryana
        state or studied there or have scored higher marks in
        written exam have marked same options for the 10 wrong
        questions irrespective of the series. Thus it can be inferred
        that predetermined candidates were supplied with answer
        keys during or prior to the examination resulting in same
        options for wrong answers. Such type of similarity while
        marking one of the option out of four is abnormal which
        cannot take place without outside help during or prior to
        examination.

46.      Against test booklet/answer keys, the following were the

observations:-

        "8.2.1 On examination of the test booklets series A, B, C

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                                    Page 73 of 96
         & D provided by the HR, following is observed:

        a.    No column was provided for mentioning the Roll
        No. hence; there exist possibility to exchange the test
        booklets for copying and also providing the answers from
        outside.

        b.        Test Date and Post code was not mentioned.

        c.    There was no instruction on wrong answer or
        negative marking.

        d.     Instruction for use of mobiles/calculators or
        electronic gadgets is not mentioned in the test booklet.

        e.     No instructions were given in the booklet for filling
        up the OMR sheets.

        f.     The used test booklets were sought from HR
        directorate but the concerned officials have no clue
        whether the test booklet are given to the candidates after
        completion of written examination or still available with
        the recruiting agency. This confirms that Directorate of
        HR did not pay much needed attention to the recruitment
        process.

        8.2.2 The pattern of the question paper for IT discipline is
        kept at par with non technical disciplines i.e 50%
        questions from the IT discipline and 50% from General
        Knowledge/Aptitude/Reasoning/English etc. Whereas in
        the other technical disciplines 70% of the questions were
        from technical side and 30% questions were from General
        Knowledge/Aptitude/Reasoning/English etc. The treatment
        of IT as non technical discipline is not justified and it
        appears that no thgout was given for deciding pattern of
        question paper for this highly technical discipline.

        8.2.3. The questions asked in the written test were
        randomly checked and following has been noticed:
        8.2.3.1     Among general questions two numbers of
        questions were found wrong. (Q. No.2 & 21 in series „A‟,
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                      Page 74 of 96
         Q. No.55 & 14 in series „B‟, Q. No.27 & 46 in series „C‟
        and Q. No.12 & 31 in series „D‟) as there is no correct
        answer in first question and in the second question the
        question asked itself is wrong.

        8.2.3.2     On perusal of the answer keys submitted by
        the agency to Dte. Of HR in a sealed cover, it is seen that
        same is not certified or countersigned by the authorized
        signatory.

        8.2.3.3      It has also been observed from the answer
        keys that no correct answer is given against one question
        i.e Booklet Series A-Q No.14, B-Q. No.7, C-Q.NO.39 & D-
        Q. No.24. However it is found that the agency has
        evaluated the OMR sheets by taking option 3 as correct
        answer for this question. This shows that the agency‟s
        casual approach during evaluation.

47.      The final conclusion of the Directorate of Vigilance is as under:-

        "Conclusion

        From the observations made through stage wise analysis
        brought out in previous sections, following conclusions
        can be made:

        9.1 The recruitment process has been manipulated to
        favour a set of candidates belonging to Delhi region
        especially Haryana state or those candidates who have
        obtained their qualifying degree from this state. The
        higher written marks of these candidates with their poor
        credentials do not match with the average marks obtained
        by all India candidates with better credentials. Further it
        has been noticed that a large percentage of their options of
        wrong questions matches with each other which is
        abnormal while marking one out of four options. Thus it
        can be concluded that their results were predetermined by
        one of the following possible manipulation:
        9.1.1 These candidates might have been supplied with the
        answer keys prior to/during the examination.

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                     Page 75 of 96
         9.1.2 The OMR sheets were left blank by the candidates
        and the same were filled up later o before declaration of
        results and these concocted answer sheets (OMR) were
        submitted to AAI to support the predetermined result of the
        written examination.

        9.2 The agency for conducting the written exam was
        hired by falsification of the facts, eliminating competition
        and without verifying the credentials. Further the agency
        was given free hand in the conduct of the examination and
        no proper checks and balances were put in place, therefore
        involvement of the concerned HR officials in the
        manipulation cannot be ruled out.

        9.3 The integrity of the results provided by the agency is
        also doubtful in view of the wrong questions in the test
        booklets and discrepancies in the answer keys like no
        answers for one question and error in marks obtained by
        one of the candidate i.e Ms. Mona Taneja.

        9.4 The recruitment agency M/s CPR does not falls
        under the purview of the Corporate Vigilance department,
        therefore detailed investigation of this case could not be
        carried out.       However, detailed investigation on
        irregularities in the appointment of the agency may be
        ordered for fixing responsibility of the concerned HR
        officials."

48.      That even the Committee constituted by the Chairman of the

Airports Authority of India on the advise of the, the then learned

Additional Solicitor General also submitted its report on November 7,

2013. The Committee in its report, was of the opinion that the whole

process of the written examination conducted by the agency is only

questionable. According to the Committee, in the given situation, it is

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                    Page 76 of 96
 possible to correct the faulty process of examination by conducting

written test again without involving the previous agency subject to

maintaining all other conditions of the recruitment.

49.      In the report filed by the respondents after undertaking the process

as directed by this Court vide its order dated May 1, 2015, it is stated that

with respect to 45 petitioners the report details as under:-

        "Report on Recruitment to the posts of JE (IT/Engg-
        Civil/Engg-Elect/Airport Ops)

        Learned ASG who appeared in the matter on 01.05.2015 to

        Junior Executive (Engg-Elec), Junior Executive (Engg-
        Civil), Junior Executive (IT) & Junior Executive (Airport
        Operations) to examine whether there was any
        irregularities w.r.t the petitioners.

        Accordingly, a committee consisting of officers of
        Vigilance and HR Department have tabulated the data and
        analyzed the facts.

        As brought out above the average common wrong answers
        for 3 petitioners are around 7. However, being the less
        number of petitioner the comparison of common wrong
        answers among all the question booklet series is difficult.

        As there is no negative marking in the test the reason for
        not attempting a question creates doubt about the
        candidate.

        Even after not attempting several questions, the petitioner
        Sh. Mohit Panwar got fairly good marks in written
        examination and 8 marks out of 30 in interview. But still
        the petitioner was in select list. Further the 9 questions he
        has not attempted are same as of the other petitioners with
        similar options. It appears and indicate that the petitioner
        is a manipulated candidate.

        Relationship between questions in different booklet
        series:

        There was mathematical relation between question
        booklets of different series, as evident from question
        booklet for JE (Engg. Civil) herein below:

         Relationship between questions in different booklet series:
         There was mathematical relation between question booklets of
         different series, as evident from question booklet for JE (Engg.

         All the non technical questions among all the series are from 1 to
         36 and subject specific technical question starts from 37 upto 120.
         As evident from above table the sequence of the questions are

          same.

         Moreover, as same questions were there in different series
         question papers (in different orders), these 6 petitioners out of 8
         have given common wrong options for 17 questions:

         3.        Other observations:

         a) No clear cut instructions were there whether candidate‟s Roll
            no., Booklet series, test form no. is to be filled with pen or
            pencil resultantly some petitioners have filled the same with
            pen and some with pencil.

         b) There was a column of battery number on the OMR sheets. As
            this number was for answer key, it should have been given in
            bar



W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                                                 Page 89 of 96
          code form.

         c) There was no negative working. But still petitioners have not
         answered all questions. Usually, when negative marking is not
         there, candidates try to answer all questions. Moreover in some
         cases, it has been observed that candidate has erased the right
         options marked earlier and left them blank E.g. Mr. Sumit Kohli
         (Roll No. 117204). This appears to have been done to manipulate
         the ranking to accommodate General Category candidate.

         d) Almost all the petitioners either belong to Haryana Region of
         have done their studies from Haryana Region.

         e) Petitioners‟ marks in the academic studies were not good, but
         still they were able to score high in written test.

         f) On test booklets, no column has been provided for mentioning
         the Roll number. Hence there exist possibility to exchange the test
         booklets for copying and also providing the answers from outside.

         4. Conclusion
         a) Comparing the analysis of the results of the all the four posts in
         question to which petitioners belong, it can be concluded beyond
         doubt that, the recruitment process has been manipulated to
         favour a set of candidates (petitioners) belonging to Delhi region
         mainly Haryana state or those candidates who have obtained their
         qualifying degree from the state. The higher written marks of these
         candidates with their poor credentials do not match with the
         average marks obtained by all India candidates with better
         credentials. Further it has been noticed that a large percentage of
         their options of wrong questions matches with each other which is
         abnormal while marking one out of four options. Had there been a
         fair competition such similarities in the results of written
         examination in all these discipline was not possible by any means.
         Following possibilities exists for the manipulation of the results:

         i. These candidates must have been supplied with the answer keys
         prior to/during the examination.

         ii. The OMR sheets were left blank by the petitioners and the same

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                      Page 90 of 96
          were filled up later on before declaration of results and these
         concocted answer sheets (OMR) were submitted to AAI to support
         the predetermined and result of the written examination.

         b) On careful examination of the answering patterns, result of
         written examination, the Centre of examinations and credentials of
         the petitioners vis a vis other candidates, it appears that the
         petitioners belongs to category of tainted candidates."

50.      When the initial decision was taken on January 31, 2014 to redo

the written examination, the report of the Committee and the Directorate

of Vigilance with regard to recruitment process to the post of JE (I.T)

were available. A perusal of the report of the Directorate of Vigilance,

even though with regard to IT exam, it is noted, like, the agency‟s

inability in adopting 9/10 digit roll numbers, the agency was already

having pre-printed test booklets/OMR sheets in advance before the

conduct of the exam; it was not checked as to how many candidates have

downloaded their hall tickets; the half ticket to the candidates was not

having their scanned photographs and signatures uploaded at the time of

application for matching the same during the written examination; no

cross check or re-verification of the result vis-a-vis marks obtained by

the successful candidates has been done by the HR as a confirmation; 11

out of 11 General candidates, 4 out of 5 OBC candidates, 2 out of 3 SC

candidates and 1 out of 1 ST candidate selected for the post, are from

Delhi region; out of 20 candidates selected, 14 are from Haryana State or

W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                    Page 91 of 96
 have obtained their qualifying degree from this State; the selected

candidates mostly from Haryana or studied there; have scored up to 20%

higher marks in the written exams as compared to other State/region; 6

out of 1 General candidates; 3 out of 5 OBC candidates were selected

due to higher written marks and scored lower marks in Interview.          Out

of 20 successful candidates, 8 candidates are from Maharishi Dayanand

University and 3 candidates are from Kurukshetra University; the

unsuccessful candidates, from Haryana were 5 out of 36, and who had

also scored, 20% more marks than other candidates in their respective

categories but were not selected due to poor marks in the Interview.

Apart from the above, many infirmities have been pointed out by the

Vigilance Directorate in its report. The report reflect certain omission

and commission on the part of the HR department as well. In substance,

it is noted, from the report, that various infirmities, procedure

irregularities, likelihood of unfair means having been adopted, had a

bearing on the result of the examination.

51.      Similar is the position, in the preliminary report submitted

pursuant to the order of this Court dated May 1, 2015, with regard to the

other disciplines. The reports having been reproduced, are self speaking.

It is not a case, where there was no material before the competent

authority, while he took a decision (even though preliminary report was
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                 Page 92 of 96
 not there). The material in the form of vigilance report being a detailed

one, was sufficient for the authority to come to a conclusion to cancel the

examination. The subsequent preliminary report submitted pursuant to

the order of this Court would also justify the action. When material

exists, the decision is justifiable. Suffice to state, it is for the agency

which is seized of the matter, to come to a definite conclusion on the

culpability with regard to the conduct of the exam. A perusal of the

three reports, it would be seen that there has been a systemic failure in

the conduct of the recruitment process and possible irregularities having

been committed during the conduct of the written examination. Mr.

Sanjay Jain, learned Additional Solicitor General, during the course of

the arguments, had submitted that the Airports Authority of India would

not, in any way, cast aspersion on the petitioners, who have been named

in the reports as the investigation/enquiries have been carried out by the

Airports Authority of India through their inhouse mechanism unlike an

investigating agency. According to him, the nature of results depicting

the successful candidates being from one State who had taken

examination in Delhi centre, as the statistics reflects, does denote that the

conduct of the recruitment process by the agency is not above Board. In

other words, it is his submission, that it is not possible to separate

untainted candidates from the tainted ones. He would also state, that
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                     Page 93 of 96
 there is some material with the authorities for forming an opinion to

cancel the recruitment process in the larger public interest when the posts

in question are public posts.               The submission made by Mr. Jain is

appealing inasmuch as the relevant reports even though naming some of

the petitioners is only to drive a point that the nature of statistics

including the correct answers/wrong answers does support irregularities.

He may be right in suggesting that no aspersion can be cast on the

petitioners as the respondent itself decided to allow all the petitioners to

sit in the fresh recruitment process by allowing them age relaxation/fee

exemption. If they were regarded as tainted, there was no question of

allowing them to take part in the fresh recruitment process.

52.      The submission of Ms. Jyoti Singh to justify the results, on various

grounds including that, Delhi Centre being a big centre consisting of 11

States, and it is natural that the maximum number of applicants are in

this Centre, so also the number of candidates qualifying the examination,

is not appealing, when on a deeper look on the reports referred to above,

does indicate an abnormal outcome, which would justify the impugned

action.

53.      Insofar as the submissions made by other counsels i.e. Mr. Rahul

Sharma, Mr.U.P.Singh, and Mr. Manoj V. George that there is no

evidence of wrong doing against any of their clients is concerned, suffice
W.P.(C) No. 2204-2014 & connected matters                         Page 94 of 96
 to state, in view of the conclusion of this Court above, that the conduct

of the examination per se, by the agency, as well as certain omissions

and commissions on the part of the HR Department, being not above

board and the final outcome of the recruitment process, being against

public interest, which requires public posts should be manned through a

fair, transparent and legitimate process, the plea is liable to be rejected.

Even the submission of Mr. Manoj V. George that some of the

petitioners have taken examination from the other centres, would also

not hold good when the process followed, which resulted in low

attendance;         likelihood of irregularities having been committed, which

had an ultimate effect on the results, is also rejected.

54.      Insofar as the other judgments relied upon by the learned counsel

for the petitioners i.e. Smt. Kiran Juneja and Ors. (supra), Girish

Srivastava and Ors. (supra), Neeraj Chaurasia (supra), Vikas Pratap

Singh and Ors. (supra), Union of India & Ors. Vs. Kuldeep Kumar

(supra) and Manoj Manu & Anr. (supra), on the aspect of irregularities

in the examination, are concerned, they have no application in the facts

of these cases and the conclusion arrived at by this Court above, in the

preceding paras. The action of the respondents needs to be upheld.

Suffice to state, anything said in this judgment is limited to the impugned
