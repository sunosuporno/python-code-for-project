1.          The present petition has been filed under Section 439 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for grant of regular bail to the

petitioner in case bearing FIR No.53 dated 17.11.2021 registered under

Sections 419, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code,

1860 and Section 14 of the Foreigner Act No.31, 1946 and Section 12,

12-A of the Passport Act No. 15 of 1967 at Police Station Cyber Crime,

Faridabad, District Faridabad.

2.           In brief, the case of the prosecution is that a complaint was

received from Amrik Singh that he has two accounts in ICICI and

HDFC banks. He had made a profile on matrimonial site, i.e., Sangam

Matrimony and through that site, he came in contact with a girl namely

Rongpipi. He started chatting with the said girl through Whatsapp on

03.10.2021. She disclosed that she was a resident of Amsterdam

(Netherland). She shared her family photographs and disclosed that she

is working as a nurse in Hospital Holland in Netherland. Thereafter, he

received a call from said girl through another WhatsApp number

disclosing that her mobile phone has broken. Thereafter, they decided

to meet so that the matter can proceed further. Her brother namely

Chaten Rongpipi also spoken to him through WhatsApp call.

Ultimately, they planned to visit India and said girl also sent her flight

tickets on his WhatsApp number. They were to reach Chattarpati

Shivaji Airport, Mumbai on 15.11.2021. On that day, he received a call

from mobile No. 9289013826 that both his guests have come from

Netherland along with demand draft of Rs. 88 lacs and in view of the

huge amount, they had been stopped at the airport. The complainant

also talked to Shanti Rongpipi and Chetan Rongpipi and they also

disclosed that they had been stopped at the airport. The caller of mobile

No. 9289013826 disclosed her name as Priyanka Gupta from

Immigration Department, Mumbai and directed him to deposit an

amount of Rs. 5,78,000/- in different five accounts of UCO Bank, IDFC

Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. He deposited a total amount of Rs.

5,78,000/-. Thereafter, he again received a call from Priyanka, who

was demanding his account number on the ground that said draft is to

be deposited in his account as they were not having bank account in

India and consequently, said amount has been fraudulently taken away

from him. On the basis of this application, FIR was lodged. During

investigation,     Chinonso      Roy         Akata   and   Mamta,   who    was

misrepresenting herself as Priyanka, were apprehended on 19.11.2021.

Two passports of different countries were recovered from accused

Chinonso Roy Akata.

3.          Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner

contends that as per the version of the prosecution, the complainant had

himself come in contact with some girl namely Rongpipi claiming to

belong to Netherland and that she had stated that she would be coming

to India to meet him. A call was received by the complainant from

Rongpipi that they had been apprehended at the Mumbai Airport. The

complainant purportedly also received a call from some Priyanka Gupta

from the Immigration Department, Mumbai directing the complainant

to deposit an amount of Rs. 5,78,000/- in five different Bank Accounts.

It is alleged that the said amount was deposited by the complainant.

4.          He further submits that none of the Bank Accounts belong

to the petitioner and that no such amount has been transferred to his

Account. Furthermore, the other co-accused who was arrested by the

police including the girl who had made a call posing herself from the

Immigration Department, Mumbai namely Mamta has already been

granted concession of regular bail by the Additional Sessions Judge,

Faridabad along with other co-accused. He contends that the only

allegation against the petitioner is that he was in possession of a fake

passport and that he was acting in collusion with Mamta. He contends

that there is no link to establish connectivity of the petitioner with

Mamta and that the alleged fake Passport was used for the purposes of

executing a rent deed. The same ipso facto does not establish the

participation of the petitioner in commission of the offence. He points

out the sentence which is prescribed under the Passports Act is

punishable up to the period of one year along with the offences under

the Foreigners Act. It is also urged that there is no evidence to show

that the petitioner had impersonated or defrauded the complainant in

any manner or induced him to deposit any amount. He is also not the

recipient of any money claimed to have been transferred by the

complainant.

5.          Per contra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State

contends that the petitioner is the person on whose instance, guidance

and help, other persons used to commit the Cyber crimes. He thus

argues that the petitioner is the main accused. However, on a pointed

query raised to the learned State counsel regarding the manner of the

commission of crime and attribution against the petitioner, there is no

definite response. Additionally, the State has failed to point out as to

the manner in which the petitioner was actually working for or in

conspiracy/collusion with the other co-accused and as to how the sale

proceeds were being shared. There is also no detail as to whether the

petitioner and other accused had indulged in any other offence or not

and as such in the absence of any criminal antecedents, it cannot be

assumed that the petitioner was involved in the business of committing

Cyber Crime and cheating various persons. He, however, expresses an

apprehension that the petitioner is a foreign national and as such there

is every possibility of the petitioner absconding from the process of law

upon being released on bail. He nevertheless, does not dispute the fact

that the petitioner is in custody since 26.11.2021 and that investigation

in the case is complete but charge has not been framed so far. It is not

disputed that it is a magisterial trial. He, however, asserts that the

recovery of the Passports along with Rent Deed and an amount of Rs.

25,000/- is effected from the petitioner.

6.           Controverting the aforesaid arguments advanced by the

learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent-State, learned

counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner contends that even though

03 mobile phone handsets are stated to have been recovered from the

possession of the petitioner, however, there is no evidence to link that

the said mobile handsets/mobile phone numbers were used in making

any call to the complainant. The recovery of the Rent Agreement ipso

facto does not make out the offence for which the petitioner is being

prosecuted i.e. cheating the complainant and inducing him to transfer

any money. Furthermore, the recovery of two passports is only to the

extent of entering into a Rent Agreement and does not ipso facto

establish the link of the petitioner in commission of the offence as

aforesaid. The recovery of a sum of Rs. 25,000/- is not linked to the

alleged amount transferred by the complainant in the Account of the

accused. Hence, merely because the petitioner was in possession of

some money does not mean that the said amount is a proceed of a

crime.

7.            I have heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

respective parties and have gone through the record with their

assistance.

8.            Without examining the merits of the instant case and

taking into consideration, the period of custody already undergone, the

absence of the prosecution to collect or refer to any evidence to show

participation of the petitioner in commission of the offence and clean

antecedents of the petitioner, I deem it appropriate to enlarge the

petitioner on bail to the satisfaction of the trial Court.

9.            The instant petition is allowed and the petitioner is ordered

to be released on bail on his furnishing requisite bail bond/heavy

surety bond to the satisfaction of the Trial Court/Duty Magistrate,

concerned and also subject to the following conditions:

              i)     he shall surrender his passport before the Court

                     while furnishing his bail/surety bonds.

              ii)    he shall mark his presence personally before the

                     SHO concerned on the 2 nd and 4th Monday of

                     every month.
              iii)   he shall always keep his mobile location on and

                      the concerned Chief Judicial Magistrate/Duty

                      Magistrate.

10.             It is made clear that the petitioner shall not extend any

threat and shall not influence any prosecution witnesses in any manner

directly or indirectly.

11.             The observation made hereinabove shall not be construed

as an expression on the merits of the case and the trial Court shall

decide the case on the basis of available material.
