                                                               JUDGMENT

                             CHANDRA DHARI SINGH, J.

                                       "यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठस्ित्तदेवेिरो जनः। स यत्प्रमाणं कुरुिे लोकस्िदनवु ितिे।।"
                             1.    The shloka from Bhagwad Gita succinctly states - whatever action
                             is performed by a leader, common men follow in his footsteps; and
                             whatever standards he sets by his acts, are pursued by his subjects. "With
                             great power comes great responsibilities" - goes another popular quote.

                              The persons who are mass leaders and occupy high offices must conduct
                             themselves with utmost integrity and responsibility. Leaders elected in a
                             democracy like that of India, owe their responsibility not only towards the
                             electorate in their own constituency, but also towards the society/nation
                             as a whole and ultimately to the Constitution. It is they who are the role
                             models for the ordinary masses. Thus, it does not befit or behove the
                             leaders to indulge in acts or speeches that cause rifts amongst
                             communities, create tensions, and disrupt the social fabric in the society.

                             2.    Hate speeches especially delivered by elected representatives,
                             political and religious leaders based on religion, caste, region or ethnicity
                             militate against the concept of fraternity, bulldoze the constitutional
                             ethos, and violates Articles 14, 15, 19, 21 read with Article 38 of the
                             Constitution and is in blatant derogation of the fundamental duties
                             prescribed under Article 51-A (a), (b), (c), (e), (f), (i), (j) of the
                             Constitution and therefore warrant stringent peremptory action on the part
                             of Central and State Governments.

                             3.    The instant petition arises out of the impugned order of dismissal
                             of Application of Petitioners under Section 156 (3) of Code of Criminal
                             Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the "Code") dated 26.08.2020
                             passed in Ct. Case No. 04/2020 titled Brinda Karat & Anr. v. State, by the

                             Avenue Courts, Delhi (hereinafter referred to as the "ACMM"). By way

                                        was recorded that on the basis of allegations levelled in
                                        the complaint, prima facie no cognizable offence was
                                        found to be committed. The Copy of the Status Report
                                        was supplied to the other side and arguments were heard.
                                        The matter was posted for orders on 2nd March 2020.

                                     j. On 2nd March 2020, the Court of ACMM-I was informed
                                        that a WP (CRL) 565/2020 titled as "Harsh Mander and
                                        Another v. GNCTD and Others" was pending before this
                                        High Court containing the same averments and seeking
                                        the same relief as was being made in the petitioners'
                                        application. In view of the fact that the High Court was
                                        already seized of the matter and had listed the matter for
                                        13th April 2020 giving the opportunity to the Union of
                                        India for filing its response, the ACMM chose not to pass
                                        any order in the application till the outcome of the said
                                        writ petition.

                                     k. On 26th August 2020, the ACMM dismissed the
                                        Petitioners' Application under Section 156(3) of the
                                        Code, recording the finding that the application was not
                                        tenable in the eyes of law on the ground that there was no
                                        previous         sanction       obtained     by       the

                                           prosecute the named individuals for the offences alleged
                                           in the complaint.

                                         l. Aggrieved by the said Order, the petitioners have
                                           approached this Court under Articles 226/227 of the
                                           Constitution of India read with Sections 482/483 of the
                                           Code praying inter alia for setting aside of the impugned
                                           Order.

                             SUBMISSIONS

                             5.    Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners submitted
                             that the communal, incendiary, and hateful speeches made by Mr. Verma
                             and Mr. Thakur directly contributed towards fostering an atmosphere of
                             hatred and division targeting a particular religious community. It is
                             submitted that the speeches further served to embolden persons and
                             contributed significantly to a rise in hostility and enmity against the anti-
                             CAA protestors, resulting in multiple incidents of threats and violence.
                             Some such incidents were enumerated in the Petitioner's Application
                             under Section 156(3) CrPC and are also enumerated in the present
                             Petition.

                             6.    Additionally, it is submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
                             Amish Devgan v. Union of India and Ors. (2021) 1 SCC 1, has held that
                             the impact of hate speech depends on the person who has uttered the
                             words and a speech by a person of influence, such as a top government
                             functionary or political leader of following, therefore carries far more

                              credibility and impact than a common person. The Supreme Court further
                             held that malicious intent can be derived from the context of the speech
                             itself, the identity of the speaker, the targeted and non-targeted group, the
                             context and circumstances when such speech was made and proximate
                             nexus with the harm.

                             7.    It is submitted that in the present case, the speeches were made by
                             influential political leaders to large groups of people during elections with
                             the clear intent to promote hatred and enmity against persons from a
                             particular community. It is stated that the tacit endorsement of such
                             communal sentiment resulted in multiple escalating incidents of threats
                             and violence.

                             8.    Further, it is submitted that the hate speeches made by Mr. Thakur
                             and Mr. Verma evidently sought to refer to an identifiable set of persons,
                             fomenting inimical sentiments against them, and such persons clearly fall
                             within a "religion" or "community" of persons as envisaged in Section
                             153A of IPC.

                             9.    It is submitted that the context in which the utterance was made by
                             the accused makes it amply clear that the same constitutes hate speech. It
                             is stated that the speeches were also prima facie intended to promote
                             hatred, enmity and ill-will against such a community. Even without such
                             escalation, the content of the speeches is divisive and communal in
                             nature.

                             10.   It is also submitted that the ingredients of the offences of hate
                             speech under Sections 153A/ 153B/ 295A/ 298/ 504/ 505/ 506 of IPC

                              have clearly been made out in the facts and circumstances of this case.
                             The police have not only a legal obligation but also a duty of care and
                             protection towards the public and ought to have registered an FIR on the
                             Complaint of the Applicant at the first instance.

                             11.   It is submitted that it is a settled law that no sanction is required in
                             order to register an FIR by the police; failing which, it is well-within the
                             powers of the Magistrate to direct investigation under Section 156(3) of
                             Code. It is submitted that if the said judicial power is ousted, there will be
                             no recourse for genuine complainants against the inaction of the police in
                             a case such as the present one.

                             12.   It is submitted that even otherwise, there is no procedure prescribed
                             for an individual to approach the competent authorities to obtain sanction
                             under Section 196 of the Code, prior to filing an Application under
                             Section 156(3) of the Code. If an individual were to approach authorities
                             for grant of sanction, such individual would necessarily need to collect all
                             evidence that is required, along with a request, as the police/ CBI does in
                             the case of obtaining prior sanction under Section 19 PC Act/ Section 197
                             of the Code, in terms of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
                             CBI v. Ashok Kumar Aggarwal (2014) 14 SCC 295. The following
                             extract is indicative of the burden that would be placed on a member of
                             the general public prior to sending a request for sanction:

                                    (a) The prosecution must send the entire relevant record to the
                                   sanctioning authority including the FIR, disclosure statements,
                                   statements of witnesses, recovery memos, draft charge sheet
                                   and all other relevant material. The record so sent should also
                                   contain the material/document, if any, which may tilt the
                                   balance in favour of the accused and on the basis of which, the
                                   competent authority may refuse sanction.

                                   (b) The authority itself has to do complete and conscious
                                   scrutiny of the whole record so produced by the prosecution
                                   independently applying its mind and taking into consideration
                                   all the relevant facts before grant of sanction while discharging
                                   its duty to give or withhold the sanction.

                                   (c) The power to grant sanction is to be exercised strictly
                                   keeping in mind the public interest and the protection available
                                   to the accused against whom the sanction is sought. The order
                                   of sanction should make it evident that the authority had been
                                   aware of all relevant facts/materials and had applied its mind to
                                   all the relevant material.

                                   (d) In every individual case, the prosecution has to establish
                                   and satisfy the court by leading evidence that the entire relevant
                                   facts had been placed before the sanctioning authority and the
                                   authority had applied its mind on the same and that the
                                   sanction had been granted in accordance with law."

                             13.   It is stated that Section 196 of the Code is different from Section 19
                             of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Section 197 of Code. A bare

                             indicate that the requirement of prior sanction even at the stage of

                             the same:

                                   a. Anil Kumar (supra):

                                   "13. ...We find it difficult to accept that contention. Subsection
                                   (3) of Section 19 has an object to achieve, which applies in
                                   circumstances where a Special Judge has already rendered a
                                   finding, sentence or order. In such an event, it shall not be
                                   reversed or altered by a court in appeal, confirmation or
                                   revision on the ground of absence of sanction. That does not
                                   mean that the requirement to obtain sanction is not a
                                   mandatory requirement. Once it is noticed that there was no
                                   previous sanction, as already indicated in various judgments
                                   referred to hereinabove, the Magistrate cannot order
                                   investigation against a public servant while invoking powers
                                   under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C."

                                   b. Manju Surana (supra):

                                   "... Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Additional Solicitor General
                                   sought to canvas the view taken in the last two judgments
                                   referred to aforesaid to submit that application of mind was
                                   necessary to exercise power under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C.
                                   and that credibility of information was to be weighed before
                                   ordering investigation (Ramdev Food Products (P) Ltd. v. State
                                   of Gujarat). It was, thus, submitted that allegation against a
                                   public servant under the P.C. Act offences are technical in
                                   nature and would require a higher evaluation standard and
                                   thus the Magistrates ought to apply their mind before ordering
                                   investigation against public servant. The consequences of
                                   starting investigation under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C., it
                                   was submitted, would result in the police registering an FIR
                                   (Suresh Chand Jain v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Mohd.
 Yousuf v. Afaq Jahan). Thus, a situation may arise where a

                                   registered against a public servant, who may have no role in the
                                   allegation made."

                             14.   It is submitted that reliance placed upon Anil Kumar (supra) to
                             submit that prior sanction is required for directions under Section 156(3)
                             of the Code is erroneous since, the findings therein pertained specifically
                             to sanction under Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988
                             (PC Act) and not with respect to the provisions of the Code. Further, the
                             said findings are contrary to settled law establishing that proceedings
                             under Section 156(3) of the Code would not amount to taking cognizance
                             and has been doubted in Manju Surana (supra). The judgment of the
                             Supreme Court in Manju Surana (supra) interprets Anil Kumar (supra)
                             as applicable to cases under the PC Act and further refers to the question
                             of whether sanction under the PC Act is necessary to maintain an
                             application under Section 156(3) of the Code to a larger bench. This
                             interpretation is a binding precedent as on date and has not been doubted
                             or challenged as yet. It is therefore submitted that the judgment of the
                             Hon'ble Supreme Court in Anil Kumar (supra) must be read as limited to
                             the PC Act, and even that ratio is not good law as on date, as argued in
                             the following paragraphs.

                             15.   It is further submitted that Anil Kumar (supra) is per incuriam
                             several decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, including RR Chari v.
                             State of UP (AIR 1951 SC 207), and Gopal Das Sindhi v. State of Assam
                             (AIR 1961 SC 986). Section 196 of the Code categorically bars a court
                             from taking cognizance for the offences prescribed therein without a prior
                             sanction. It is settled law in a plethora of cases including, Manju Surana

                             SCC 459, State of Karnataka v. Pastor P. Raju (2006) 6 SCC 728 that
                             application of mind for ordering an investigation under Section 156(3)
                             would not amount to taking cognizance. The judgment in Pastor P. Raju
                             (supra) in fact holds as under:

                                   "A plain reading of this provision will show that no Court can
                                   take cognizance of an offence punishable under Section 153-B
                                   or sub- section (2) or sub-section (3) of Section 505 of Indian
                                   Penal Code or a criminal conspiracy to commit such offence
                                   except with the previous sanction of the Central Government or
                                   of the State Government or of the District Magistrate. The
                                   opening words of the Section are "No Court shall take
                                   cognizance" and consequently the bar created by the provision
                                   is against taking of cognizance by the Court. There is no bar
                                   against registration of a criminal case or investigation by the
                                   police agency or submission of a report by the police on
                                   completion of investigation, as contemplated by Section 173
                                   Cr.P.C. If a criminal case is registered, investigation of the
                                   offence is done and the police submits a report as a result of
                                   such investigation before a Magistrate without the previous
                                   sanction of the Central Government or of the State Government
                                   or of the District Magistrate, there will be no violation of
                                   Section 196(1-A) Cr.P.C. and no illegality of any kind would be
                                   committed."
                             16.   It is submitted that this Court in Bhagwati Devi Gupta v. Star
                             Infratech, 2021 SCC OnLine Del 3995, observed that once a bench of
                             the Supreme Court has doubted the correctness of an earlier bench of co-
                             equal strength and referred the issue to a larger bench, it would be
                             debatable whether courts lower in hierarchy should continue to follow the
                             earlier decision.

                              17.   It is further submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Jayant
                             and Ors. v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (2021) 2 SCC 670 dealt with
                             Section 22 of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act,
                             1957 ("MMDR Act"), which bars a court from taking cognizance of an
                             offence punishable under the MMDR Act except upon complaint made in
                             writing by a person authorized in this behalf by the Central or State
                             Government. In this case, the Supreme Court upheld the order of the Ld.
                             Magistrate who in exercise of suo moto powers conferred under Section
                             156(3) CrPC had directed the police to register an FIR, conduct
                             investigation and submit a report under the MMDR Act. Relying on
                             settled law, the Supreme Court held that at this stage, it cannot be said
                             that the Ld. Magistrate had taken any cognizance of the alleged offences
                             attracting the bar under Section 22 MMDR Act, and that there is no bar
                             against registration or investigation of a criminal case or submission of a
                             report by the police under Section 173(8) of Code.

                             18.   It is also stated that while the contents of the aforesaid speeches
                             prima facie demonstrate the commission of cognizable offences, the
                             inaction on the part of state agencies, and non-registration of FIR,
                             provides implicit sanction for such utterances to be repeated, as it did in
                             the present case. As a matter of public policy, and in furtherance of the
                             fundamental precepts of criminal law, the power of the Ld. Judicial
                             Magistrate under Section 156(3) of the Code to ensure the discharge of
                             the duty of the state agencies to register the FIR in a timely manner must
                             not and cannot be abrogated from.

                              19.   In light of the aforesaid, it is therefore prayed that there is no bar to
                             the exercise of power under Section 156(3) of the Code and that the
                             Order dated 26th August 2020 passed by the Ld. ACMM (I), Rouse
                             Avenue Courts, Delhi in Ct. Cas. No. 04/2020 be set aside by this Court.

                             20.   Per Contra, Mr. Amit Mahajan, learned CGSC appearing for the
                             Respondents submitted that the issue which arises for consideration of
                             this Hon'ble Court is whether a sanction under Section 196 of the Code is
                             necessary prior for any direction being issued by Ld. ACMM for
                             registration of FIR under Section 156(3) of CrPC.

                             21.   It is submitted that a bare perusal of Section 196 of the Code would
                             show that no court can take cognizance of any offence punishable under
                             Chapter VI or under Section 153A, 295A or sub-section (1) of Section
                             505 of IPC without previous sanction of the Central Government or the
                             State Government as the case may be. Similarly, Section 197 provides
                             that when any person who is or was a public servant not removable from
                             his office save by or with the sanction of the Government is accused of
                             any offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or
                             purporting to act in discharge of his official duty, no court shall take
                             cognizance of such offence except with the previous sanction. In the
                             present case also, the allegations have been levelled under various
                             Sections including Section 295-A, 153-A and Section 505 of the IPC.

                             22.   It is further submitted that the petitioner has argued that the
                             sanction is only required when the court takes cognizance after filing of a
                             chargesheet and for the purpose of giving directions for investigation

                              under Section 156(3) of CrPC, no such sanction is required. This issue is
                             no longer res integra.

                             23.   The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Anil Kumar (supra) and
                             L. Narayana Swamy v. State of Karnataka & Ors (2016) 9 SCC 598
                             have specifically held that the court cannot direct registration of FIR or
                             investigation into an offence while exercising power under Section
                             156(3) of CrPC in relation to offence where the sanction is required to be
                             taken before a court can take cognizance.

                             24.   It is further submitted that a perusal of the status report of the
                             respondent would reveal that on the basis of the allegations levelled by
                             the Petitioners, the respondents came to the conclusion that prima-facie
                             no cognizable offence was found to be committed. It is submitted that
                             once the investigation agency comes to the conclusion that no offence
                             had been made out, the Magistrate has to apply his mind to direct the
                             registration of FIR, however, in such cases want of sanction is mandatory
                             and once it is noticed that there was no previous sanction, the Magistrate
                             cannot order investigation against a public servant while invoking powers
                             under Section 156(3) CrPC.

                             25.   In view of the above submissions, it is submitted that the instant
                             petition is devoid of merits and this Court may be pleased to dismiss the
                             present petition.

                              QUESTION FOR ADJUDICATION

                             27.   A mere perusal of the impugned order makes it evident that the
                             ACMM has not entered into the merits of the case and has decided the
                             complaint before it on the ground of jurisdiction, on the point that he
                             lacked the jurisdiction to entertain the complaint on merits because of
                             want of sanction from the Competent authority to prosecute the two
                             named individuals.

                             28.   Thus, the only question for consideration before this Court is
                             limited to the extent of adjudicating whether the ACMM has rightly
                             dismissed the said complaint.

                             ANALYSIS

                             29.   In the instant case, the concerned Court in its impugned order
                             dismissed the Petitioners' Application under Section 156(3) of the Code
                             seeking investigation/registration of FIR, finding that the application was
                             not tenable in the eyes of law on the ground that there was no previous
                             sanction obtained by the petitioners from the competent authority to
                             prosecute the named individuals for the offences alleged in the complaint.

                             30.   For a better appreciation of the case at hand, it is pertinent to
                             peruse and analyse the provisions of law invoked in the instant petition
                             before delving deeper into the facts of the case.

                                   154. Information in cognizable cases.-- (1) Every information
                                   relating to the commission of a cognizable offence, if given
                                   orally to an officer in charge of a police station, shall be

                                   discloses the commission of a cognizable offence, shall either
                                   investigate the case himself or direct an investigation to be
                                   made by any police officer subordinate to him, in the manner
                                   provided by this Code, and such officer shall have all the

                                   that offence.

                             33.   As held in the case of Hasib v. State of Bihar, (1972) 4 SCC 773,
                             the object and scope of the first information report from the point of view
                             of the informant is to set the criminal law in motion and from the point of
                             view of the investigating authorities is to obtain information about the
                             alleged criminal activity so as to be able to take suitable steps for tracing
                             and bringing to book the guilty party.

                             34.   The only condition precedent for registering an FIR is that the
                             information should disclose a cognizable offence. The requirement of
                             Section 154 of the Code is only that the report must disclose the
                             commission of a cognizable offence and that is sufficient to set the
                             investigating machinery into action.

                             35.   In Section 154(1) of the Code, the Parliament in its wisdom has
                             used the expression 'information' without qualifying the same as was
                             done in Section 41(1)(a) or (g) of the Code wherein the expressions,
                             'reasonable complaint' and 'credible information' are used. Evidently, the
                             non-qualification of the word 'information' in Section 154(1) unlike in
                             Section 41(1)(a) and (g) of the Code can be interpreted to be existing for
                             the reason that the Police Officer ought not to refuse to record an
                             information/register a case relating to the commission of a cognizable
                             offence on the ground of him not being satisfied with the reasonableness
                             or credibility of the information. Thus, it is evident that 'reasonableness'

                              or 'credibility' of the said information is not a condition precedent for
                             registration of a case.

                             36.   A Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Lalita
                             Kumari v. Govt. of U.P., (2014) 2 SCC 1 held that registration of First
                             Information Report is mandatory under Section 154 of the CrPC, if the
                             information discloses commission of a cognizable offence. If the
                             information received does not disclose a cognizable offence but indicates
                             the necessity for an inquiry, a preliminary inquiry may be conducted only
                             to ascertain whether a cognizable offence is disclosed or not.

                             37.   At this stage it is enough if the Police Officer on the basis of the
                             information given suspects the commission of a cognizable offence, and
                             not that he must be convinced or satisfied that a cognizable offence has
                             been committed. If he has reasons to suspect, based on the information
                             received, that a cognizable offence may have been committed, he is
                             bound to record the information and conduct an investigation. At this
                             stage it is also not necessary for him to satisfy himself about the
                             truthfulness of the information.

                             38.   The legislative intent is thus unambiguous - to ensure that every
                             cognizable offence is promptly investigated in accordance with law.
                             Having stated so, there is no reason that there should be any discretion or
                             option left with the police to register or not to register an FIR when
                             information is given about the commission of a cognizable offence. Every
                             cognizable offence must be investigated promptly in accordance with law
                             and all information provided under Section 154 of the Code about the

                             initiate an offence.

                             39.   Now, the next question that flows from the aforesaid discussion is
                             what options are available upon a refusal of lodging of FIR by the police.

                             Remedies for Refusal to Lodge an FIR & Scope of 156(3)

                             40.   Section 154 (3) in itself provides the recourse. Any person
                             aggrieved by a refusal on the part of an officer in charge of a police
                             station to lodge the FIR may send the substance of such information, in
                             writing and by post, to the Superintendent of Police concerned who, if
                             satisfied that such information discloses the commission of a cognizable
                             offence, shall either investigate the case himself or direct an investigation
                             to be made by any police officer subordinate to him, in the manner
                             provided by this Code, and such officer shall have all the powers of an
                             officer in charge of the police station in relation to that offence.

                             41.   The insertion of sub-section (3) of Section 154, by an amendment,
                             reveals the intention of the Legislature to ensure that no information of
                             commission of a cognizable offence must be ignored or not acted upon.

                             42.   In the landmark case of Sakiri Vasu v. State of U.P., (2008) 2 SCC
                             409, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:

                                   26. If a person has a grievance that his FIR has not been
                                   registered by the police station his first remedy is to approach
                                   the Superintendent of Police under Section 154(3) CrPC or
                                   other police officer referred to in Section 36 CrPC. If despite

                                    to in Section 36 his grievance still persists, then he can
                                   approach a Magistrate under Section 156(3) CrPC instead of
                                   rushing to the High Court by way of a writ petition or a petition
                                   under Section 482 CrPC. Moreover, he has a further remedy of
                                   filing a criminal complaint under Section 200 CrPC. Why then
                                   should writ petitions or Section 482 petitions be entertained
                                   when there are so many alternative remedies?

                                   27. As we have already observed above, the Magistrate has very
                                   wide powers to direct registration of an FIR and to ensure a
                                   proper investigation and for this purpose he can monitor the
                                   investigation to ensure that the investigation is done properly
                                   (though he cannot investigate himself). The High Court should
                                   discourage the practice of filing a writ petition or petition under
                                   Section 482 CrPC simply because a person has a grievance that
                                   his FIR has not been registered by the police, or after being
                                   registered, proper investigation has not been done by the
                                   police. For this grievance, the remedy lies under Sections 36
                                   and 154(3) before the police officers concerned, and if that is of
                                   no avail, under Section 156(3) CrPC before the Magistrate or
                                   by filing a criminal complaint under Section 200 CrPC and not
                                   by filing a writ petition or a petition under Section 482 CrPC.

                                   28. It is true that alternative remedy is not an absolute bar to a
                                   writ petition, but it is equally well settled that if there is an
                                   alternative remedy the High Court should not ordinarily
                                   interfere."

                             43.   After exhausting the steps mentioned in Section 154(1) and Section
                             154(3) the aggrieved person can file a complaint before the Magistrate for
                             a direction under Section 156(3) to police to register FIR.

                                    such station would have power to inquire into or try under the
                                   provisions of Chapter XIII.

                                   (2) No proceeding of a police officer in any such case shall at
                                   any stage be called in question on the ground that the case was
                                   one which such officer was not empowered under this section to
                                   investigate.

                             44.   Section 156(3) unambiguously states that any Magistrate
                             empowered under Section 190 may order an investigation into a
                             cognizable offence. However, the Magistrate cannot act as a mere 'Post
                             Office' in forwarding such a complaint for investigation, meaning thereby
                             that the direction by the Magistrate for investigation under S.156(3)
                             should not be issued as a matter of routine or passed in a mechanical
                             manner, without application of judicial mind.

                             45.   While expounding the nature of power exercised by the Magistrate

                             Reddy (1976) 3 SCC 252, held as under:

                                   "17. ... It may be noted further that an order made under sub-
                                   section (3) of Section 156, is in the nature of a peremptory
                                   reminder or intimation to the police to exercise their plenary
                                   powers of investigation under Section 156(1). Such an
                                   investigation embraces the entire continuous process which
                                   begins with the collection of evidence under Section 156 and
                                   ends with a report or charge-sheet under Section 173."

                              46.   The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Dilawar Singh v. State
                             of Delhi (2007) 12 SCC 641 ruled as under:

                                   "18. ...'11. The clear position therefore is that any Judicial
                                   Magistrate, before taking cognizance of the offence, can order
                                   investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code. If he does so, he
                                   is not to examine the complainant on oath because he was not
                                   taking cognizance of any offence therein. For the purpose of
                                   enabling the police to start investigation it is open to the
                                   Magistrate to direct the police to register an FIR. There is
                                   nothing illegal in doing so. After all registration of an FIR
                                   involves only the process of entering the substance of the
                                   information relating to the commission of the cognizable
                                   offence in a book kept by the officer in charge of the police
                                   station as indicated in Section 154 of the Code. Even if a
                                   Magistrate does not say in so many words while directing
                                   investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code that an FIR
                                   should be registered, it is the duty of the officer in charge of the
                                   police station to register the FIR regarding the cognizable
                                   offence disclosed by the complainant because that police officer
                                   could take further steps contemplated in Chapter XII of the
                                   Code only thereafter.' [Ed. : See Mohd. Yousuf v. Afaq Jahan,

                             the Magistrate taking cognizance of the offences, has opined that having
                             considered the complaint, the Magistrate may consider it appropriate to
                             send the complaint to the police for investigation under Section 156(3) of
                             the Code of Criminal Procedure.

                                    "18. When a Magistrate receives a complaint he is not bound to
                                   take cognizance if the facts alleged in the complaint disclose the
                                   commission of an offence. The Magistrate has discretion in the
                                   matter. If on a reading of the complaint, he finds that the
                                   allegations therein disclose a cognizable offence and the
                                   forwarding of the complaint to the police for investigation
                                   under Section 156(3) will be conducive to justice and save the
                                   valuable time of the Magistrate from being wasted in enquiring
                                   into a matter which was primarily the duty of the police to
                                   investigate, he will be justified in adopting that course as an
                                   alternative to taking cognizance of the offence itself. As said
                                   earlier, in the case of a complaint regarding the commission of
                                   a cognizable offence, the power under Section 156(3) can be
                                   invoked by the Magistrate before he takes cognizance of the
                                   offence under Section 190(1)(a). However, if he once takes such
                                   cognizance and embarks upon the procedure embodied in
                                   Chapter XV, he is not competent to revert back to the pre-
                                   cognizance stage and avail of Section 156(3)." [Ed. : See also

                             49.   The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Priyanka Srivastava v. State of
                             U.P., (2015) 6 SCC 287 held as under:

                                   "29. At this stage it is seemly to state that power under Section
                                   156(3) warrants application of judicial mind. A court of law is
                                   involved. It is not the police taking steps at the stage of Section
                                   154 of the Code. A litigant at his own whim cannot invoke the
                                   authority of the Magistrate. A principled and really grieved
                                   citizen with clean hands must have free access to invoke the
                                   said power. It protects the citizens but when pervert litigations
                                   takes this route to harass their fellow citizens, efforts are to be
                                   made to scuttle and curb the same."

                              50.   It was also held that in an appropriate case, the learned Magistrate
                             would be well advised to verify the truth and also can verify the veracity
                             of the allegations. The Hon'ble Supreme Court went on to held as under:

                                   "30. In our considered opinion, a stage has come in this
                                   country where Section 156(3) CrPC applications are to be
                                   supported by an affidavit duly sworn by the applicant who seeks
                                   the invocation of the jurisdiction of the Magistrate. That apart,
                                   in an appropriate case, the learned Magistrate would be well
                                   advised to verify the truth and also can verify the veracity of the
                                   allegations. This affidavit can make the applicant more
                                   responsible. We are compelled to say so as such kind of
                                   applications are being filed in a routine manner without taking
                                   any responsibility whatsoever only to harass certain persons.
                                   That apart, it becomes more disturbing and alarming when one
                                   tries to pick up people who are passing orders under a statutory
                                   provision which can be challenged under the framework of the
                                   said Act or under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. But it
                                   cannot be done to take undue advantage in a criminal court as
                                   if somebody is determined to settle the scores.
                                   31. We have already indicated that there has to be prior
                                   applications under Sections 154(1) and 154(3) while filing a
                                   petition under Section 156(3). Both the aspects should be
                                   clearly spelt out in the application and necessary documents to
                                   that effect shall be filed. The warrant for giving a direction that
                                   an application under Section 156(3) be supported by an
                                   affidavit is so that the person making the application should be
                                   conscious and also endeavour to see that no false affidavit is
                                   made. It is because once an affidavit is found to be false, he will
                                   be liable for prosecution in accordance with law. This will deter
                                   him to casually invoke the authority of the Magistrate under
                                   Section 156(3). That apart, we have already stated that the
                                   veracity of the same can also be verified by the learned
                                   Magistrate, regard being had to the nature of allegations of the

                                     justice it is considered appropriate to straightaway direct
                                     investigation, such a direction is issued.

                                     22.2. The cases where Magistrate takes cognizance and
                                     postpones issuance of process are cases where the Magistrate
                                     has yet to determine 'existence of sufficient ground to
                                     proceed'."
                             52.     Another question that arises is the scope of the powers of the
                             magistrate under Section 156(3). In the case of Anil Kumar v. M.K.
                             Aiyappa (2013) 10 SCC 705, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held:

                                     "11. The scope of Section 156(3) CrPC came up for
                                     consideration before this Court in several cases. This Court

                                    in Maksud Saiyed [Maksud Saiyed v. State of Gujarat, (2008) 5
                                   SCC 668 : (2008) 2 SCC (Cri) 692] examined the requirement
                                   of the application of mind by the Magistrate before exercising
                                   jurisdiction under Section 156(3) and held that where
                                   jurisdiction is exercised on a complaint filed in terms of Section
                                   156(3) or Section 200 CrPC, the Magistrate is required to
                                   apply his mind, in such a case, the Special Judge/Magistrate
                                   cannot refer the matter under Section 156(3) against a public
                                   servant without a valid sanction order. The application of mind
                                   by the Magistrate should be reflected in the order. The mere
                                   statement that he has gone through the complaint, documents
                                   and heard the complainant, as such, as reflected in the order,
                                   will not be sufficient. After going through the complaint,
                                   documents and hearing the complainant, what weighed with the
                                   Magistrate to order investigation under Section 156(3) CrPC,
                                   should be reflected in the order, though a detailed expression of
                                   his views is neither required nor warranted. We have already
                                   extracted the order passed by the learned Special Judge which,
                                   in our view, has stated no reasons for ordering investigation."
                             53.   In the case of Vinubhai Haribhai Malaviya v. State of Gujarat,
                             (2019) 17 SCC 1, it was held that the scope of Magistrate's power under
                             Section 156(3) is very wide. Under Section 156(3), by virtue of Article 21
                             of the Constitution, all powers necessary, which may also be incidental or
                             implied, are available to the Magistrate to ensure a proper investigation in
                             the matter in the sense of a fair and just investigation by the police. The
                             said power includes ordering of further investigation after submission of
                             police report under Section 173(2) CrPC. Exercise of that power is
                             available even at post-cognizance stage until trial commences i.e. charges
                             are framed. This power can also be exercised suo motu by the Magistrate
                             himself, depending on the facts of each case.

                              54.   When the information is laid with the police, but no action in that
                             behalf is taken, then the complainant has another option to his recourse -
                             under Section 190 read with Section 200 of the Code, to lay the complaint
                             before the Magistrate having jurisdiction to take cognizance of the
                             offence and the Magistrate is required to enquire into the complaint as
                             provided in Chapter XV of the Code. In case the Magistrate, after
                             recording evidence, finds a prima facie case, instead of issuing process to
                             the accused, he is empowered to direct the police concerned to investigate
                             into offence under Chapter XII of the Code and to submit a report. If he
                             finds that the complaint does not disclose any offence to take further
                             action, he is empowered to dismiss the complaint under Section 203 of
                             the Code. In case he finds that the complaint/evidence recorded prima
                             facie discloses an offence, he is empowered to take cognizance of the
                             offence and could issue process to the accused.

                             55.   In Section 156 (3), the word used is "may". The use of the word
                             "shall" in Section 154(3) and the use of word "may" in Section 156 (3)
                             clearly lays down the intention of the legislation. Had the legislature
                             intended to mandate and close options for the Magistrate, they could have
                             used the word "shall" as has been done in S.154(3). Instead, they chose to
                             use the word "may". This is significant, and gives a very clear indication,
                             that the Magistrate has the discretion in the matter, and can, in
                             appropriate cases, refuse to order registration.

                             56.   Magistrate may direct the police to register a case and investigate
                             or he may treat the same as a complaint and proceed in matter
                             contemplated in Chapter XV of Code. He should apply his judicial mind.

                              Magistrate if takes cognizance, may proceed to follow the procedure
                             provided in Chapter XV of Code. Magistrate may either take cognizance
                             under S.190 or may forward the complaint to police under S.156(3) for
                             investigation.

                             57.   In the case of Sukhwasi v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 2007 SCC
                             OnLine ALL 1088, the Allahabad HC held that the Magistrate is not
                             bound to order for registration of an FIR in all cases where a cognizable
                             offence has been disclosed and the Magistrate has authority to treat it as a
                             complaint.

                             58.   Having dealt with the scheme of the Code, and before dealing with
                             the correctness of the Order of the Magistrate, since the speeches in
                             question were allegedly hate speeches, it is pertinent to refer to the law
                             against hate speech.

                             Law regarding Hate Speech

                             59.   Hate speeches incite violence and feelings of resentment against
                             members of specific communities, thereby causing fear and feeling of
                             insecurity in the minds of the members of those communities. In fact, it
                             marginalizes individuals based on their membership in a group by using
                             expressions that expose the group to hatred. Hate speeches are almost
                             invariably targeted towards a community to impart a psychological
                             impact on their psyche, creating fear in the process. Hate speeches are the
                             beginning point of attacks against the targeted community that can range
                             from discrimination to ostracism, ghettoization, deportation, and, even to
                             genocide.

                              60.   The methodology is not restricted to any religion or community in
                             specific. There have been and there continue to be instances of hate
                             speeches in different parts of the country targeted against people of
                             specific communities, based upon the demographic composition. There
                             have even been instances of demographic shifts in the aftermath of such
                             Hate/Inflammatory speeches, the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits from the
                             Kashmir valley is a prime example.

                             61.   Article 19 of the Indian Constitution provides for freedom of
                             speech and expression with reasonable restrictions and the same is not an
                             absolute right. The reasonable restrictions include public order, decency
                             or morality or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement
                             to an offence. Hate speeches not only cause defamation but also incite
                             offences against a particular sect of religion of this nation.

                             62.   Black's Law Dictionary, 9th Edition defines the expression 'hate
                             speech' as under:

                                   "Speech that carries no meaning other than the expression of
                                   hatred for some group, such as a particular race, especially in
                                   circumstances in which the communication is likely to provoke
                                   violence."
                             63.   Article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)
                             as adopted by General Assembly provides that everyone is equal and
                             entitled to equal protection against discrimination, and against incitement
                             to such discrimination.

                              64.    Further, the International Covenant on Civil & Political Rights,
                             1966 (ICCPR), which India ratified in 1992 places positive obligations to
                             limit speech on governments. Article 20(2) of the ICCPR states that "any
                             advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement
                             to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law." In
                             other words, Article 20(2) requires the signatory governments to prohibit
                             "hate speech."

                             65.    Similarly, Articles 4 and 6 of the International Convention on the
                             Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, 1965 (ICERD)
                             prohibits the elements of hate speech and mandates the member states to
                             make a law prohibiting any kind of hate speech through a suitable
                             framework of law.

                             66.    The Courts of the United Kingdom and Canada have recognized a
                             'duty of care' by the police as a component of both private and public
                             law.

                             67.    In Robinson v West Yorkshire Police [2018] UKSC 4 at Paragraph
                             69, speaking for the majority, Lord Reed stated that:

                                    "(1) I do not suggest that the discussion of policy
                                    considerations in cases such as Hill, Brooks and Smith should
                                    be consigned to history. But it is important to understand that
                                    such discussions are not a routine aspect of deciding cases in
                                    the law of negligence, and are unnecessary when existing
                                    principles provide a clear basis for the decision, as in the
                                    present appeal. I would not agree with Lord Hughes's statement
                                    that they are the ultimate reason why there is no duty of care
                                    towards victims, suspects or witnesses imposed on police

                                  The absence of a duty towards victims of crime, for example,
                                  does not depend merely on a policy devised by a recent
                                  generation of judges in relation to policing: it is based on the
                                  application of a general and long-established principle that the
                                  common law imposes no liability to protect persons against
                                  harm caused by third parties, in the absence of a recognised
                                  exception such as a voluntary assumption of responsibility.[ ...]

                                  (4) The distinction between careless acts causing personal
                                  injury, for which the law generally imposes liability, and
                                  careless omissions to prevent acts (by other agencies) causing
                                  personal injury, for which the common law generally imposes
                                  no liability, is not a mere alternative to policy-based reasoning,
                                  but is inherent in the nature of the tort of negligence. For the
                                  same reason, although the distinction, like any other distinction,
                                  can be difficult to draw in borderline cases, it is of fundamental
                                  importance. The central point is that the law of negligence
                                  generally imposes duties not to cause harm to other people or
                                  their property: it does not generally impose duties to provide
                                  them with benefits (including the prevention of harm caused by
                                  other agencies). Duties to provide benefits are, in general,
                                  voluntarily undertaken rather than being imposed by the
                                  common law, and are typically within the domain of contract,
                                  promises and trusts rather than tort. It follows from that basic
                                  characteristic of the law of negligence that liability is generally
                                  imposed for causing harm rather than for failing to prevent
                                  harm caused by other people or by natural causes. It is also
                                  consistent with that characteristic that the exceptions to the
                                  general non-imposition of liability for omissions include
                                  situations where there has been a voluntary assumption of
                                  responsibility to prevent harm (situations which have sometimes
                                  been described as being close or akin to contract), situations
                                  where a person has assumed a status which carries with it a
                                  responsibility to prevent harm, such as being a parent or
                                  standing in loco parentis, and situations where the omission
                                  arises in the context of the defendant's having acted so as to
                                  create or increase a risk of harm".

                              68.   The Supreme Court of Canada in Saskatchewan (Human Rights
                             Commission) v. Whatcott 2013 SCC 11, succeeded in bringing out the
                             "human rights" obligations leading to control on publication of "hate
                             speeches" for protection of human rights defining the expression "hate
                             speech" observing that the definition of "hatred" set out in Canada
                             (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, (1990) 3 SCR 892, with some
                             modifications, provides a workable approach to interpreting the word
                             "hatred" as is used in legislative provisions prohibiting hate speech.
                             Three main prescriptions must be followed. First, courts must apply the
                             hate speech prohibition objectively. The question courts must ask is
                             whether a reasonable person, aware of the context and circumstances,
                             would view the expression as exposing the protected group to hatred.
                             Second, the legislative term "hatred" or "hatred or contempt" must be
                             interpreted as being restricted to those extreme manifestations of the
                             emotion described by the words "detestation" and "vilification". This
                             filters out expression which, while repugnant and offensive, does not
                             incite the level of abhorrence, delegitimization and rejection that risks
                             causing discrimination or other harmful effects. Third, the Courts must
                             focus their analysis on the effect of the expression at issue, namely -
                             whether it is likely to expose the targeted person or group to hatred by
                             others. The repugnancy of the ideas being expressed is not sufficient to
                             justify restricting the expression, and whether or not the author of the
                             expression intended to incite hatred or discriminatory treatment is
                             irrelevant. The key is to determine the likely effect of the expression on
                             its audience, keeping in mind the legislative objectives to reduce or
                             eliminate discrimination.

                              69.     Referring back to the Indian position as laid down by the Courts, in
                             Ramesh v. Union of India, AIR 1988 SC 775, while dealing with the
                             subject, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed:

                                     "... that the effect of the words must be judged from the
                                     standards of reasonable, strong-minded, firm and courageous
                                     men, and not those of weak and vacillating minds, nor of those
                                     who scent danger in every hostile point of view."

                             70.     Article 15 of the Constitution of India provides for prohibition of
                             discrimination against any citizen on grounds of only of religion, race,
                             caste, sex, or place of birth or any of them. The Hon'ble Supreme Court
                             on numerous instances has reiterated the same, in Zahira Habibulla H.
                             Sheikh v. State of Gujarat (2004) 4 SCC 158, this Hon'ble Court held
                             that:

                                     "65. In a country like ours with heterogeneous religions and
                                     multiracial and multilingual society which necessitates
                                     protection against discrimination on the ground of caste or
                                     religion taking lives of persons belonging to one or the other
                                     religion is bound to have dangerous repercussions and reactive
                                     effect on the society at large and may tend to encourage
                                     fissiparous elements to undermine the unity and security of the
                                     nation on account of internal disturbances. It strikes at the very
                                     root of an orderly society, which the founding fathers of our
                                     Constitution dreamt of.
                                     66. When the ghastly killings take place in the land of Mahatma
                                     Gandhi, it raises a very pertinent question as to whether some
                                     people have become so bankrupt in their ideology that they
                                     have deviated from everything which was so dear to him. When
                                     a large number of people including innocent and helpless

                                    disgrace to the entire society. Criminals have no religion. No
                                   religion teaches violence and cruelty-based religion is no
                                   religion at all, but a mere cloak to usurp power by fanning ill
                                   feeling and playing on feelings aroused thereby. The golden
                                   thread passing through every religion is love and compassion.
                                   The fanatics who spread violence in the name of religion are
                                   worse than terrorists and more dangerous than an alien
                                   enemy."

                             71.   The Hon'ble Supreme Court has recognized 'hate speech' as being
                             violative of constitutional guarantees under Article 14, 15 and 21. In the
                             case of Pravasi Bhalai Sangathan v. Union of India (2014) 11 SCC 477,
                             at Paragraph 8, it has been held that it is the idea of discrimination that
                             lies at the heart of hate speech principles. It was held as under:

                                   "8. Hate speech is an effort to marginalise individuals based on
                                   their membership in a group. Using expression that exposes the
                                   group to hatred, hate speech seeks to delegitimise group
                                   members in the eyes of the majority, reducing their social
                                   standing and acceptance within society. Hate speech, therefore,
                                   rises beyond causing distress to individual group members. It
                                   can have a societal impact. Hate speech lays the groundwork
                                   for later, broad attacks on 26 vulnerable sections that can
                                   range from discrimination, to ostracism, segregation,
                                   deportation, violence and, in the most extreme cases, to
                                   genocide. Hate speech also impacts a protected group's ability
                                   to respond to the substantive idea under debate, thereby placing
                                   a serious barrier to their full participation in our democracy."
                             72.   By way of the said judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
                             specified that laws related to "Hate Speech" must be applied
                             "objectively" and has noted that the problem with laws relating to Hate
                             Speech is rooted in their non-execution.

                              73.   Pursuant to the aforesaid judgment of Pravasi Bhalai Sangathan
                             (supra) the Law Commission of India reviewed the laws on Hate speech
                             and made recommendations in its 267th Report. Relevant extracts from
                             the same are reproduced hereunder:

                                   "Tests for determining hate speech

                                   4.13 Three tests have been adopted by the courts while
                                   recognising whether a speech amounts to hate speech or not.
                                   Once it has been established that there has been an interference
                                   with freedom of expression, the courts resort to a three-fold
                                   analysis to determine the legitimacy of such interference:

                                         (a) Is the interference prescribed by law? The law that
                                         allows limitation of article 10 of ECHR must be
                                         prescribed by the statute and must be precise so that
                                         the citizens can regulate their conduct in accordance
                                         with the law and foresee the consequences of the
                                         impermissible conduct.

                                         (b) Is the interference proportionate to the legitimate
                                         aim pursued? It has been opined by the court in
                                         Handyside v. United Kingdom,49 that the restrictions
                                         imposed by the State under article 10(2) on freedom of
                                         expression must be 'proportionate to the legitimate
                                         aim pursued.'
                                         (c) Is the interference necessary in a democratic
                                         society? This test requires a careful examination of the
                                         fact to determine whether the freedom was limited in
                                         pursuance of a legitimate social need and in order to
                                         protect the principles and values underlying ECHR.

                                    5.3 In order to qualify as hate speech, the speech must be
                                   offensive and project the extreme form of emotion. Every
                                   offensive statement, however, does not amount to hate speech.
                                   The expressions advocacy and discussion of sensitive and
                                   unpopular issue have been termed 'low value speech'
                                   unqualified for constitutional protection.

                                   6.2 Incitement to violence cannot be the sole test for
                                   determining whether a speech amounts to hate speech or not.
                                   Even speech that does not incite violence has the potential of
                                   marginalising a certain section of the society or individual. In
                                   the age of technology, the anonymity of internet allows a
                                   miscreant to easily spread false and offensive ideas. These ideas
                                   need not always incite violence but they might perpetuate the
                                   discriminatory attitudes prevalent in the society. Thus,
                                   incitement to discrimination is also a significant factor that
                                   contributes to the identification of hate speech."

                              75.    In the case of Patricia Mukhim v. State of Meghalaya and Ors., in
                             Criminal Appeal No. 141 of 2021, dated 25 th March 2021, the Hon'ble
                             Supreme Court while referring to its earlier rulings including Bilal
                             Ahmed Kaloo v. State of A.P. (1997) 7 SCC 431 and Ramesh v. Union
                             of India (1998) 1 SCC 668, and Pravasi Bhalai Sangathan v. Union of
                             India & Ors. (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that:

                                    "Free speech of citizens of this country cannot be stifled by
                                    implicating them in criminal cases, unless such speech as the
                                    tendency to affect public order."

                             76.    Therefore, before initiating criminal proceedings for what one
                             thinks it to be hate speech, the words of the Hon'ble Supreme Court must
                             be taken into consideration.

                             77.    In India, the constitutionality of hate speech restrictions has been
                             upheld in the interest of 'public order' in as much as it continues to be
                             punishable under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 as well as other laws and
                             statutes in force, an illustrative list of which is provided hereunder:

                             existing legal regime.

                             79.   Effective regulation of "hate speeches" at all levels is required and
                             all the law enforcing agencies must ensure that the existing law is not
                             rendered a dead letter. Enforcement of the aforesaid provisions is
                             required being in consonance with the proposition "salus reipublicae
                             suprema lex" (safety of the state is the supreme law).

 Section 196 of the Code and Requirement of Sanction

                             80.   Before delving into the question regarding the requirement of
                             sanction under Section 196 and the stage at which such a sanction is
                             required to be seen, it is pertinent that the provision be perused and
                             analysed.

                             81.   Section 196 of the Code reads as under:

                                   "196. Prosecution for offences against the State and for
                                   criminal conspiracy to commit such offence.--

                                   (1) No Court shall take cognizance of--

                                          (a) any offence punishable under Chapter VI or under
                                          Section 153-A, Section 295-A or sub-section (1) of
                                          Section 505 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (45 of
                                          1860), or

                                          (b) a criminal conspiracy to commit such offence, or
                                          (c) any such abetment, as is described in Section 108-A

                                  (2) No court shall take cognizance of the offence of any
                                  criminal conspiracy punishable under Section 120-B of the
                                  Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), other than a criminal
                                  conspiracy to commit an offence punishable with death,

                                  District Magistrate has consented in writing to the initiation of

                                         Provided that where the criminal conspiracy is one to

                                  shall be necessary.

                              82.   Upon studying the aforesaid provision one can unambiguously
                             infer that no court can take cognizance of any offence punishable under
                             Chapter VI or under Section 153A, 295A or sub-section (1) of Section
                             505 of IPC without previous sanction of the Central Government or the
                             State Government as the case may be. Similarly, Section 197 provides
                             that when any person who is or was a public servant not removable from
                             his office save by or with the sanction of the Government is accused of
                             any offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or
                             purporting to act in discharge of his official duty, no court shall take
                             cognizance of such offence except with the previous sanction. In the
                             instant case, the allegations have been levelled under various Sections
                             including Section 295-A, 153-A and Section 505 of the IPC, all of which
                             require prior sanction for prosecution under Section 196 of the Code.

                             83.   For deciding the question as to at what stage the requirement of
                             sanction is to be seen, it is pertinent to refer to the decided case laws
                             relied upon by the parties.

                             84.    In the case of Anil Kumar v. M.K. Aiyappa, (2013) 10 SCC 705,
                             it was held as under:

                                   "11. The scope of Section 156(3) CrPC came up for
                                   consideration before this Court in several cases. This Court in

                                   the Magistrate before exercising jurisdiction under Section
                                   156(3) and held that where jurisdiction is exercised on a

                                   156(3) against a public servant without a valid sanction order.
                                  The application of mind by the Magistrate should be reflected in
                                  the order. The mere statement that he has gone through the
                                  complaint, documents and heard the complainant, as such, as
                                  reflected in the order, will not be sufficient. After going through
                                  the complaint, documents and hearing the complainant, what
                                  weighed with the Magistrate to order investigation under
                                  Section 156(3) CrPC, should be reflected in the order, though a
                                  detailed expression of his views is neither required nor
                                  warranted. We have already extracted the order passed by the
                                  learned Special Judge which, in our view, has stated no reasons
                                  for ordering investigation.

                                  13. The expression "cognizance" which appears in Section 197
                                  CrPC came up for consideration before a three-Judge Bench of
                                  this Court in State of U.P. v. Paras Nath Singh [(2009) 6 SCC
                                  372 : (2009) 2 SCC (L&S) 200] , and this Court expressed the
                                  following view: (SCC pp. 375, para 6)
                                        "6. ... '10. ... And the jurisdiction of a Magistrate to
                                        take cognizance of any offence is provided by Section
                                        190 of the Code, either on receipt of a complaint, or
                                        upon a police report or upon information received
                                        from any person other than a police officer, or upon
                                        his knowledge that such offence has been committed.
                                        So far as public servants are concerned, the
                                        cognizance of any offence, by any court, is barred by
                                        Section 197 of the Code unless sanction is obtained
                                        from the appropriate authority, if the offence, alleged
                                        to have been committed, was in discharge of the
                                        official duty. The section not only specifies the persons
                                        to whom the protection is afforded but it also specifies
                                        the conditions and circumstances in which it shall be
                                        available and the effect in law if the conditions are
                                        satisfied. The mandatory character of the protection
                                        afforded to a public servant is brought out by the
                                        expression, 'no court shall take cognizance of such
                                        offence except with the previous sanction'. Use of the

                                          words 'no' and 'shall' makes it abundantly clear that
                                         the bar on the exercise of power of the court to take
                                         cognizance of any offence is absolute and complete.
                                         The very cognizance is barred. That is, the complaint
                                         cannot be taken notice of. According to Black's Law
                                         Dictionary the word 'cognizance' means 'jurisdiction'
                                         or 'the exercise of jurisdiction' or 'power to try and
                                         determine causes'. In common parlance, it means
                                         taking notice of. A court, therefore, is precluded from
                                         entertaining a complaint or taking notice of it or
                                         exercising jurisdiction if it is in respect of a public
                                         servant who is accused of an offence alleged to have
                                         been committed during discharge of his official duty.'
                                         [Ed.: As observed in State of H.P. v. M.P. Gupta,

                                         539.] "

                             85.   Further, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Army Headquarters v. CBI
                             (2012) 6 SCC 228 opined as follows:

                                   "82. Thus, in view of the above, the law on the issue of sanction
                                   can be summarised to the effect that the question of sanction is
                                   of paramount importance for protecting a public servant who
                                   has acted in good faith while performing his duty. In order that
                                   the public servant may not be unnecessarily harassed on a
                                   complaint of an unscrupulous person, it is obligatory on the
                                   part of the executive authority to protect him.

                                   83. If the law requires sanction, and the court proceeds against
                                   a public servant without sanction, the public servant has a right
                                   to raise the issue of jurisdiction as the entire action may be
                                   rendered void ab initio...."

                                     "12. As is clear from the plain language of the said section, the
                                   court is precluded from taking "cognizance" of an offence
                                   under certain sections mentioned in this provision if the
                                   prosecution is against the public servant, unless previous
                                   sanction of the Government (Central or State, as the case may
                                   be) has been obtained. What is relevant for our purposes is that
                                   this section bars taking cognizance of an offence. The question
                                   is whether it will cover within its sweep, order directing
                                   investigation under Section 156(3) CrPC? The High Court has
                                   taken the view, in the impugned judgment [Shashidhar v. State
                                   of Karnataka, 2014 SCC OnLine Kar 12287], that bar is from
                                   taking cognizance which would not apply at the stage of
                                   investigation by the investigating officer. It is observed that
                                   sanction is required only after investigation and that too when,
                                   after investigation, it is found that there is substantial truth in
                                   the investigation report as to what amounts to cognizance of
                                   offence."

                             87.   In the same judgment, it was further held as under:

                                   "14. In State of W.B. v. Mohd. Khalid [State of W.B. v. Mohd.
                                   Khalid, (1995) 1 SCC 684 : 1995 SCC (Cri) 266] , this Court
                                   has observed as follows:
                                         '13. It is necessary to mention here that taking
                                         cognizance of an offence is not the same thing as
                                         issuance of process. Cognizance is taken at the initial
                                         stage when the Magistrate applies his judicial mind to
                                         the facts mentioned in a complaint or to a police report
                                         or upon information received from any other person
                                         that an offence has been committed. The issuance of
                                         process is at a subsequent stage when after
                                         considering the material placed before it the court
                                         decides to proceed against the offenders against whom
                                         a prima facie case is made out.' [Ed.: As considered in

                                   The meaning of the said expression was also considered by this
                                  Court in Subramanian Swamy case [Subramanian Swamy v.
                                  Manmohan Singh, (2012) 3 SCC 64 : (2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 1041 :
                                  (2012) 2 SCC (L&S) 666] .

                                  15. The judgments referred to hereinabove clearly indicate that
                                  the word "cognizance" has a wider connotation and is not
                                  merely confined to the stage of taking cognizance of the offence.
                                  When a Special Judge refers a complaint for investigation
                                  under Section 156(3) CrPC, obviously, he has not taken
                                  cognizance of the offence and, therefore, it is a pre-cognizance
                                  stage and cannot be equated with post-cognizance stage. When
                                  a Special Judge takes cognizance of the offence on a complaint
                                  presented under Section 200 CrPC and the next step to be taken
                                  is to follow up under Section 202 CrPC. Consequently, a
                                  Special Judge referring the case for investigation under Section
                                  156(3) is at pre-cognizance stage.

                                                                ***

                                  21. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants
                                  raised the contention that the requirement of sanction is only
                                  procedural in nature and hence, directory or else Section 19(3)
                                  would be rendered otiose. We find it difficult to accept that
                                  contention. Sub-section (3) of Section 19 has an object to
                                  achieve, which applies in circumstances where a Special Judge
                                  has already rendered a finding, sentence or order. In such an
                                  event, it shall not be reversed or altered by a court in appeal,
                                  confirmation or revision on the ground of absence of sanction.
                                  That does not mean that the requirement to obtain sanction is
                                  not a mandatory requirement. Once it is noticed that there was
                                  no previous sanction, as already indicated in various judgments
                                  referred to hereinabove, the Magistrate cannot order
                                  investigation against a public servant while invoking powers
                                  under Section 156(3) CrPC. The above legal position, as
                                  already indicated, has been clearly spelt out in Paras Nath

                                   Having regard to the ratio of the aforesaid judgment [Anil
                                   Kumar v. M.K. Aiyappa, (2013) 10 SCC 705 : (2014) 1 SCC
                                   (Cri) 35] , we have no hesitation in answering the questions of
                                   law, as formulated in para 10 above, in the negative. In other
                                   words, we hold that an order directing further investigation
                                   under Section 156(3) CrPC cannot be passed in the absence of
                                   valid sanction."

                             88.   The term "cognizance" has not been defined anywhere in the Code.
                             Its origin can be traced to the Old French root "conoisance", as well as to
                             the Latin word "cognoscere". The word has been defined in Black's Law
                             Dictionary, 8th Edition as follows:

                                   "Cognizance-

                                   (1) A court's right and power to try and to determine cases;
                                   Jurisdiction,

                                   (2) The taking of judicial or authoritative notice.

                                   (3) Acknowledgement or admission of an alleged fact.

                             89.   The Advanced Law Lexicon by P. Ramanatha Aiyar defines
                             'Cognizance' in the following manner:

                                   "cognizance" means "jurisdiction" or "the exercise of
                                   jurisdiction" or "power to try and determine causes". In
                                   common parlance, it means taking notice of. A court, therefore,
                                   is precluded from entertaining a complaint or taking notice of it
                                   or exercising jurisdiction if it is in respect of a public servant
                                   who is Accused of an offence alleged to have been committed
                                   during discharge of his official duty."
                             91.   Taking cognizance by the court only means that the court has taken
                             note of the offence which has been alleged against the accused persons.
                             The judgments referred to hereinabove clearly indicate that the word
                             "cognizance" has a wider connotation and is not merely confined to the
                             stage of taking cognizance of the offence.

                             92.   It is well settled law that the court while exercising power under
                             Section 156(3) of CrPC is required to apply its mind before any order for
                             registration of FIR can be passed.

                              93.   Furthermore, an additional layer of scrutiny albeit discretionary has
                             been provided under Section 196(3) which says that the Government
                             before granting such sanction may order a preliminary investigation by a
                             police officer not below the rank of police officer. Such safeguard has
                             neither been envisioned nor been provided for under Section 197.

                             94.   Therefore, the legislative intent behind the provision was crystal
                             clear that the offences mentioned under Section 196 should not be
                             ordered to be investigated in a routine manner. If such investigations are
                             ordered in routine manner for the offences under Section 295-A, 153-A
                             and Section 505, that would lead to a situation where thousands of FIRs
                             would be registered to settle scores against political opponents across the
                             country. This would not only be undesirable and an abuse of process but
                             would also result in choking of the already overburdened criminal justice
                             machinery.

                             95.   Thus, the Legislature, being wary of such a situation, in its wisdom
                             has incorporated this two-tier mechanism, firstly, in the form of a
                             sanction and secondly, in the form of a preliminary investigation before
                             granting any sanction.

                             96.   The learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that the sanction
                             is only required when the court takes cognizance after filing of a
                             chargesheet and for the purpose of giving directions for investigation
                             under Section 156(3) of CrPC, no such sanction is required. This issue is,
                             however, no longer res integra. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case

                              Ors. (2016) 9 SCC 598 has specifically held that the court cannot direct
                             registration of FIR or investigation into an offence while exercising
                             power under Section 156(3) of Code in relation to offence where the
                             sanction is required to be taken before a court can take cognizance.

                             Limitations of Writ Jurisdiction

                             97.   In order to appreciate the case at hand, it is pertinent to refer to the
                             position of law laid down as to the exercise of the writ jurisdiction by the
                             High Court.

                             98.   In the landmark case of Whirlpool Corporation. v. Registrar of
                             Trade Marks (1998) 8 SCC 1, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had held as
                             follows: -

                                   "15. Under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court,
                                   having regard to the facts of the case, has a discretion to
                                   entertain or not to entertain a writ petition. But the High Court
                                   has imposed upon itself certain restrictions one of which is that
                                   if an effective and efficacious remedy is available, the High
                                   Court would not normally exercise its jurisdiction. But the
                                   alternative remedy has been consistently held by this Court not
                                   to operate as a bar in at least three contingencies, namely,
                                   where the writ petition has been filed for the enforcement of any
                                   of the Fundamental Rights or where there has been a violation
                                   of the principle of natural justice or where the order or
                                   proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an
                                   Act is challenged."

                             99.   Another ancillary question that is - can a person straightaway
                             approach the High Court against the refusal of police to register an FIR?
                             The same stands answered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
                             Sudhir Bhaskarrao Tambe v. Hemant Yashwant Dhage, 2016 (6) SCC

                              277. It was held that if a person has a grievance that the police have not
                             registered his complaint, or having registered it, they have not
                             investigated it properly, then the aggrieved person's remedy is not to go to
                             the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, but to
                             approach the Magistrate concerned under Section 156(3) of the Code.
                             The Hon'ble Court held as under:

                                   "2. This Court has held in Sakiri Vasu v. State of U.P. [Sakiri
                                   Vasu v. State of U.P., (2008) 2 SCC 409 : (2008) 1 SCC (Cri)
                                   440 : AIR 2008 SC 907] , that if a person has a grievance that
                                   his FIR has not been registered by the police, or having been
                                   registered, proper investigation is not being done, then the
                                   remedy of the aggrieved person is not to go to the High Court
                                   under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, but to approach
                                   the Magistrate concerned under Section 156(3) CrPC. If such
                                   an application under Section 156(3) CrPC is made and the
                                   Magistrate is, prima facie, satisfied, he can direct the FIR to be
                                   registered, or if it has already been registered, he can direct
                                   proper investigation to be done which includes in his discretion,
                                   if he deems it necessary, recommending change of the
                                   investigating officer, so that a proper investigation is done in
                                   the matter. We have said this in Sakiri Vasu case [Sakiri
                                   Vasu v. State of U.P., (2008) 2 SCC 409 : (2008) 1 SCC (Cri)
                                   440 : AIR 2008 SC 907] because what we have found in this
                                   country is that the High Courts have been flooded with writ
                                   petitions praying for registration of the first information report
                                   or praying for a proper investigation.
                                   3. We are of the opinion that if the High Courts entertain such
                                   writ petitions, then they will be flooded with such writ petitions
                                   and will not be able to do any other work except dealing with
                                   such writ petitions. Hence, we have held that the complainant
                                   must avail of his alternate remedy to approach the Magistrate
                                   concerned under Section 156(3) CrPC and if he does so, the
                                   Magistrate will ensure, if prima facie he is satisfied,

                                   investigation."

                             100. A Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court while deciding the
                             case of Waseem Haider v. State of U. P. Through Principal Secretary
                             Home, Lucknow and Ors. Misc. Bench No. 24492 of 2020, decided on
                             14th December 2020, was of the opinion that the power to issue a writ of
                             mandamus has its own well defined self-imposed limitations, one of
                             which is the availability of alternative efficacious remedy. In the
                             aforesaid judgment, the Division Bench has exhaustively dealt with the
                             alternative remedies available to a person aggrieved by non-registration
                             of FIR by the police. The Bench inter alia held that:

                                   "The writ remedy is extra-ordinary remedy and equitable
                                   remedy. Further, the writ Court need not entertain a writ
                                   petition merely because a case is made out of alleged inaction
                                   or negligent in acting on an issue by an authority vested with
                                   power, in these cases to register crime/to complete investigation
                                   into crime, if statutorily engrafted remedy is available to seek
                                   redress on such grievance. Even if, a case is made out on
                                   alleged illegal action by statutory authority, which require
                                   redressal, ordinarily writ Court does not entertain the writ
                                   petition if the aggrieved person has not availed other remedies,
                                   more so, such remedies are incorporated in a statute."

                             101. While explaining the remedies available under the Code, the Court
                             also observed:

                                   "Code of Criminal Procedure incorporates enough safeguards
                                   to victims and accused. It lays down detailed procedure in
                                   conducting investigation, filing of final report, taking of
                                   cognizance, conducting of trial. It provides enough safeguards

                                    against illegal action of police. It is a self contained code and
                                   comprehensive on all aspects of criminal law. A complainant
                                   has statutorily engrafted remedies to ensure that his complaint
                                   is taken to its logical end. Thus, he must first exhaust said
                                   remedies and cannot invoke extra-ordinary writ remedy as a
                                   matter of course, even when crime is not registered and there is
                                   no progress in the investigation."

                             Pradesh 2021 SCC OnLine SC 334, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
                             reiterated and summarized the principles governing the exercise of writ
                             jurisdiction by the High Court in the presence of an alternate remedy. The
                             Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed:

                                   "28. The principles of law which emerge are that:

                                         (i) The power under Article 226 of the Constitution to
                                         issue writs can be exercised not only for the
                                         enforcement of fundamental rights, but for any other
                                         purpose as well;
                                         (ii) The High Court has the discretion not to entertain
                                         a writ petition. One of the restrictions placed on the
                                         power of the High Court is where an effective
                                         alternate remedy is available to the aggrieved person;
                                         (iii) Exceptions to the rule of alternate remedy arise
                                         where (a) the writ petition has been filed for the
                                         enforcement of a fundamental right protected by Part

                                            a writ petition should not be entertained when an
                                           efficacious alternate remedy is provided by law;

                                           (v) When a right is created by a statute, which itself
                                           prescribes the remedy or procedure for enforcing the
                                           right or liability, resort must be had to that particular
                                           statutory remedy before invoking the discretionary
                                           remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution. This rule
                                           of exhaustion of statutory remedies is a rule of policy,
                                           convenience and discretion; and

                                           (vi) In cases where there are disputed questions of fact,
                                           the High Court may decide to decline jurisdiction in a
                                           writ petition. However, if the High Court is objectively
                                           of the view that the nature of the controversy requires
                                           the exercise of its writ jurisdiction, such a view would
                                           not readily be interfered with."

                             Commercial Steel Limited, 2021 SCC OnLine SC 884, a 3-judge bench
                             of the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:

                                   "11. ... The existence of an alternate remedy is not an absolute
                                   bar to the maintainability of a writ petition under Article 226 of
                                   the Constitution. But a writ petition can be entertained in
                                   exceptional circumstances where there is:
                                   (i)     a breach of fundamental rights;

                                   (ii)    a violation of the principles of natural justice;

                                   (iii)   an excess of jurisdiction; or

                                   (iv)    a challenge to the vires of the statute or delegated
                                           legislation.

                                   12. In the present case, none of the above exceptions was
                                   established. There was, in fact, no violation of the principles of

                                   charge of the conveyance. In this backdrop, it was not
                                   appropriate for the High Court to entertain a writ petition."

                             104. Recently, while deciding the case of Kotak Mahindra Bank
                             Limited v Dilip Bhosale, [2022 LiveLaw (SC) 545] SLP (C) 13241 of
                             2019, the Hon'ble Supreme Court reiterated that when a remedy under
                             the statute is available, filing of a writ petition under Article 226 of the
                             Constitution is to be discouraged by the High Court. It was held as under:

                                   "Before parting with the order, we would like to observe that
                                   this Court is consistent of the view and can be noticed from the
                                   judgment in United Bank of India vs. Satyawati Tandon &
                                   Ors. (2010) 8 SCC 110, that when a remedy under the statute is
                                   available and in the instant case which indeed was availed by
                                   the respondent/borrower, filing of a writ petition under Article
                                   226 of the Constitution is to be discouraged by the High
                                   Court."

                             105. The principle that emerges from the aforementioned judgments is
                             that the extraordinary writ jurisdiction is to be exercised only in rare cases
                             or certain contingencies in the interest of justice, including the
                             exceptional cases delineated above.

                             106. Thus, a writ to compel the police to conduct an investigation or
                             lodge an FIR can be denied for not exhausting the alternative and
                             efficacious remedy available under the provisions of the Code, unless the
                             exceptions enumerated in the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
                             the aforementioned judgment are satisfied. In the instant case, the
                             petitioner is yet to exercise and exhaust his alternative remedies available

                              under the provisions of the Code including challenging the impugned
                             order of the Magistrate.

                             107. In light of the aforesaid, it is settled law that the power to issue writ
                             has its own well-defined limitations imposed by the High Courts, one of
                             which is the availability of alternative efficacious remedy. Considering
                             the law laid down by the judicial precedents, the procedure laid down by
                             the Code of Criminal Procedure and as well as the fact that alternate and
                             efficacious remedy is available to the petitioner which is yet to be
                             exhausted, this Court is also of the opinion that the High Court should not
                             ordinarily, as a matter of routine, exercise its extraordinary writ
                             jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution if an effective and
                             efficacious alternate remedy is available.

                             108. Before applying the jurisprudence delineated above to the facts of
                             the instant case, it is pertinent to take note of a worrying phenomenon that
                             has gained traction and is in vogue these days is of bypassing the
                             procedure under the Code. The beauty of procedural law lies in the stages
                             and remedies available during the course of a criminal proceeding. The
                             High Courts have been flooded with writ petitions praying for registration
                             of FIRs or praying for a proper investigation. If the High Courts entertain
                             such writ petitions, it will open pandora's box and would crumble the
                             already overtaxed system. Therefore, the alternate remedies wherever
                             available must be exhausted, save in exceptional circumstances where the
                             urgent intervention of this Court is required in the interest of justice,
                             before approaching this Court.

                              109. In the instant case, the petitioner also seems to have adopted a
                             similar attitude. As per the petition, the petitioners on 29th January 2020
                             made a complaint against Mr. Anurag Thakur and Mr. Parvesh Verma to
                             the Commissioner of Police, Delhi asking for registration of FIR against
                             the two directly, without approaching the SHO. In furtherance of the said
                             complaint, on 31st January 2020, another letter was addressed to the
                             Commissioner stating therein that because of inaction of police over their
                             complaint has led to an incident wherein, according to the letter, an armed
                             man shot at protesting students.

                             110. It was only on 2nd February 2020, the petitioners, by way of a letter
                             addressed to the SHO, Parliament Street Police Station, New Delhi, made
                             a request to immediately file FIRs against Mr. Anurag Thakur and Mr.
                             Parvesh Verma, enclosing therein the two aforementioned representations
                             made earlier to the Commissioner. And within three days of the said
                             letter, on 5th February 2020, the Petitioners filed an Application under
                             Section 156(3) of the Code seeking registration of FIR before the
                             ACMM. Again, upon a dismissal of the said complaint, the petitioners
                             had the alternate remedy to approach the revisional court against the
                             impugned Order rather than approaching this Court directly by way of a
                             writ petition.

                             111. Therefore, this Court holds that the instant petition despite being
                             maintainable, does not warrant the exercise of writ jurisdiction by this
                             Court since, first, no rights, whether fundamental or legal, of the
                             petitioners stands violated which would have otherwise required the
                             intervention of this Court, in so far as the right to report a cognizable

                              offence is concerned. Second, there is no gross illegality committed in the
                             entire proceedings before the Court below. Section 156(3) remedy had
                             been availed of wherein the ACMM after having taken note of the Status
                             Report filed by the Investigating Agency and applying its judicial mind to
                             the complaint dismissed the same. Third, as discussed in the foregoing
                             paragraphs, the petitioners have failed to follow the prescribed
                             mechanism under the Code.

                             Analysis of the Impugned Order

                             112. This Court shall now test the validity of the impugned Order
                             passed by the ACMM. The petitioners had approached the ACMM under
                             Section 156(3) of the Code seeking order of registration of FIR against
                             the two named persons for the alleged offences.

                             113. Under the scheme of Section 156(3) of the Code, on the first date
                             of the proceedings, ATR was called from the DCP District New Delhi.
                             Subsequently, as per the record of the proceedings of the Court below, on
                             11th February 2020, ATR was filed by the Special Investigation Unit of
                             Crime Branch and was taken on record. On the said date, the Crime
                             Branch was directed to expedite the preliminary inquiry and file the
                             detailed ATR in next 15 days.

                             114. In the proceedings dated 26th February 2020, the status report was
                             filed by the investigating agency, wherein it was recorded that on the
                             basis of allegations levelled in the complaint, prima facie no cognizable
                             offence was found to be committed. The Copy of the Status Report was
                             supplied to the other side and arguments were heard.

                              115. On 2nd March 2020, the Court of ACMM was informed that a WP
                             (CRL) 565/2020 titled as "Harsh Mander and Another v. GNCTD and
                             Others" was pending before this High Court containing the same
                             averments and seeking the same relief as was being made in the
                             petitioners' application. In view of the fact that the High Court was
                             already seized of the matter and had listed the matter for 13 th April 2020
                             giving the opportunity to the Union of India for filing its response, the
                             ACMM chose not to pass any order in the application till the outcome of
                             the said writ petition.

                             116. Finally, on 26th August 2020, the ACMM-I dismissed the
                             Petitioners' Application under Section 156(3) of the Code, recording the
                             finding that the application was not tenable in the eyes of law on the
                             ground that there was no previous sanction obtained by the
                             complainants/petitioners from the competent authority to prosecute the
                             named individuals for the offences alleged in the complaint.

                             117. Before analysing the validity of the impugned Order, it is pertinent
                             to peruse the findings of the Status Report filed by the Investigating
                             Agency, which was considered by the ACMM. The contents of the said
                             Status Report are paraphrased hereunder:

                                       a. Regarding the allegations against Mr. Thakur, it is stated
                                          that the connotation/meaning of the word "gaddar" is
                                          traitor, and as such does not target or refer to any specific
                                          community. Thus, it does not amount to commission of
                                          any cognizable offence as alleged by the complainants.

                                       b. Qua the allegations regarding Mr. Verma, it is stated that
                                         the speaker has only stated his position on the erstwhile
                                         protest ongoing in Shaheen Bagh, and not any specific
                                         community or its members. It is further recorded by the
                                         agency that no provocation whatsoever has been made
                                         instigating the crowd to riot or for taking any retaliatory
                                         action against the protestors.

                                      c. Regarding other allegations of incidents of violence being
                                         inspired by the speeches of the two leaders, it has been
                                         recorded in the Status Report that first, separate FIRs had
                                         been lodged against the accused in those cases, second,
                                         the cases had been referred to Crime Branch for further
                                         investigation, third, none of the accused as alleged of
                                         having committed the acts of violence had attributed their
                                         actions to either of the speeches made, and fourth, there
                                         was no connection whatsoever to the speeches in
                                         question and the acts of violence.

                                   In light of the aforesaid, it has been recorded in the Status Report
                             that on the basis of allegation levelled in the complaint, prima facie no
                             cognizable offence has been found to be committed.

                             118. Every institution in this country has a purpose to serve in a
                             democratic and constitutional framework governed by the rule of law.
                             The mandate of investigative agency such as the police is sui generis. It
                             performs a key function to investigate the cases of crime, to detect and

                              collect crucial evidence that would assist the Courts of law in imparting
                             justice. Therefore, the opinion/findings of the agency merit its own
                             significance and despite the same being contestable and justiciable in a
                             Court, it cannot be prima facie discarded or brushed aside without
                             application of judicial mind.

                             119. On a perusal of the said report, it is evident that upon applying its
                             mind to the facts as alleged in the complaint, the Investigating Agency in
                             the present case has filed the status report specifically stating that no
                             cognizable offence has been made out.

                             120. Once the investigating agency upon conducting its preliminary
                             enquiry, has come to the conclusion that prima facie no cognizable
                             offence is made out, the ACMM must apply its mind to direct the
                             investigation or for registration of FIR. However, as discussed earlier, for
                             the purpose of ordering any investigation, the ACMM in the instant case
                             would be required to take cognizance of the facts/evidence before it,
                             which is not permissible without there being a valid sanction.

                             121. Another question that has been contested by the petitioners is that
                             the judgment of Anil Kumar (supra) is not a good law on the grounds of
                             it being contrary to the settled law regarding Section 156(3) and
                             cognizance; as well as on the ground that the said judgment is per
                             incuriam. The petitioners have relied on the judgment of Manju Surana
                             v. Sunil Arora and Ors. (supra).

                             122. As held in the case of Maharashtra v. Sarva Shramik Sangh
                             (2013) 16 SCC 16, it is an established principle of law that until a

                              judgment which has been referred to a larger bench is overruled, the said
                             judgment occupies the field and continues to operate as a good law. This
                             would continue until the larger bench decides the matter reliance is
                             placed.

                             123. As held in Union of India v. S.K. Kapoor, (2011) 4 SCC 589 at
                             paragraph 9, it is also well settled that if a subsequent coordinate Bench
                             of equal strength wants to take a different view, it can only refer the
                             matter to a larger Bench, otherwise the prior decision of a coordinate
                             Bench is binding on the subsequent Bench of equal strength. Therefore,
                             reliance placed on Manju Surana (supra) is clearly misplaced.

                             124. The said view taken by the Hon'ble Supreme Court has recently
                             been applied by the High Court of Calcutta in the case of Dr. Nazrul
                             Islam v. Basudeb Banerjee and Ors, 2022 SCC Online Cal 183. It was
                             held as under: -
                                   "The subsequent judgment in Manju Surana (supra) case has
                                   referred the issue to a Larger Bench but did not declare the
                                   ratio laid down in the earlier two judgments as either per
                                   incuriam or a bad law. To that extent the submission of the
                                   learned Advocate General that an issue which could not be
                                   decided subsequently by the Hon'ble Supreme Court cannot be
                                   decided by a High Court on the mere asking of the petitioner,
                                   cannot be brushed aside. The submission of the learned
                                   Advocate General that in case a reference has been made on a
                                   point of law then the last of the judgment which is authority on
                                   the point would be valid is the correct proposition to be

                                    SCC 321; Harbhajan Singh & Anr. Vs State of Punjab & Anr.,
                                   (2009) 13 SCC 608.

                                   Having regard to the subject matter by way of which the
                                   petitioner has attempt to invoke the provisions of Section 156(3)
                                   of the Code of Criminal Procedure against the public servants
                                   this Court is of the opinion that as the provision of Section 197
                                   of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been incorporated in the
                                   statute, the same has been for a meaningful purpose of allowing
                                   the public servants to discharge their duties without fear or
                                   favour or without any anticipation of being harassed because of
                                   the rigors of law. Therefore, ordinarily a valid sanction would
                                   be required in a proceeding where the provisions of Section
                                   156(3) Cr. P.C. are invoked against public servants. However,
                                   in this case substantive offences as alleged have not been made
                                   out, so the issue of sanction is an additional consideration."

                             125. What emerges is that until a judgment which has been referred to a
                             larger bench is overruled, the said judgment occupies the field and
                             continues to operate as a good law. Thus, the said issue of non-
                             applicability of the judgment of Anil Kumar (supra) stands answered in
                             the aforesaid terms.

                             126. Further, the ACMM rightly did not comment on the merits of the
                             case while dismissing the application under Section 156(3) of the Code
                             for want of sanction. It is a settled position of law that if the court is
                             dismissing the case on the ground of maintainability, it should refrain
                             from passing any order on the merits of the case.

                             127. In light of the aforesaid discussion and reasoning, what emerges is
                             firstly, that the appropriate sanction of government is required for
                             investigation under Section 196 of the Code. Secondly, there is alternative

                              and efficacious remedy available under the Code that needs to be taken
                             resort of, before invoking the writ jurisdiction of this Court. Thirdly, in
                             the instant case, the ACMM has rightly decided the application before it.
                             The provisions of Section 156(3) for directing investigation qua offences
                             mentioned in Section 196 of the Code cannot be exercised by the Court
                             without sanction. There is no prima facie irregularity that is apparent
                             upon a perusal of the impugned order. Fourthly, the petitioners have
                             failed to satisfy the Court and no case is made out warranting the
                             intervention of this Court at this stage.

                             128. Hence, in light of the foregoing discussion and analysis, there are
                             no cogent reasons to entertain the petition and allow the prayers sought
                             therein. In the aforesaid terms, the petition stands dismissed.

                             129. Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.

                             130. It is made clear that any observations made herein shall have no
                             bearings whatsoever on the merits of the case during any other
                             proceedings before any other Court.
