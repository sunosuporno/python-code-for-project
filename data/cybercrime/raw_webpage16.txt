                          prize, electronics, etc.
                          2.     Pursuant to the previous order dated 18th July, 2022, a status report
                          has been submitted by Ms. Hetu Arora Sethi, ld. ASC, GNCTD appearing

                          Delhi Police, who is present in Court. A perusal of the said status report
                          shows that a detailed investigation is already underway and there are similar
                          matters as well, where fake accounts have been created in the names of well-
                          known business houses. As per the said status report, a Special Investigation
                          Team ('SIT') has been constituted collectively in respect of four similar
                          suits, by the Cyber Crime Unit, Delhi Police, which is referred to as

                          IPC and Sections 66C, 66D of the Information Technology Act, 2000. The
                          status report reveals that there are bank accounts which are connected to
                          each other, in a cascading manner, and orders are being issued for freezing
                          of the said bank accounts. Let the investigation in this matter continue.

                          said three domain names, till further orders of this Court. All the Internet
                          Service Providers (ISPs) shall also give effect to these directions, within 24
                          hours.
                          5.       The contact details of the persons, who have registered domain names
                          shall be handed over to ld. Counsel for the Plaintiff by the DNR - GoDaddy
                          and other Registrars. Upon the details of the registrants of these domain
                          names being made available to ld. Counsel for the Plaintiff, the same shall
                          be supplied to Ms. Sethi and Mr. Lamba, so that they can carry out further

                          and blocked.
                          6.       The DNRs will also inform the Plaintiff, if the said domain names
                          have availed of any other services of the DNR such as cloud server, website
                          development and hosting services. If so, the details used for making any
                          payments such as credit card details, bank accounts details and any IP
                          address of such persons who have registered the said domain names for

                          Plaintiff. After collecting said details, the ld. Counsel for the Plaintiff shall

                           which are brought to the notice of the DNR, are not deactivated, an
                          explanation shall be provided by the DNR to the Plaintiff as to why the said
                          domain names were not deactivated, and the Plaintiff shall be at liberty to
                          move an application before the Court in this regard.
                          9.     At this stage, Mr. Khan, ld. Counsel for the DNR - Godaddy.com
                          LLC submits that the order relating to non-registration of any domain name
                          containing the mark 'MEESHO' may not be passed, as it may block several
                          genuine users from registering domain names. If the DNR is of the view that
                          there are genuine domain names, an application may be moved.
                          10.    This Court has perused the status report submitted by the Cyber
                          Crime Unit and is convinced that the Plaintiff's well-known mark
                          'MEESHO' is now being used by fraudulent persons, who carry out illegal
                          activities over the internet. The order directing the DNR not to register any
                          domain names containing the mark 'MEESHO' is being passed under such
                          extenuating circumstances, where the status report reveals that several
                          vulnerable persons are being duped of huge sums of money by registering
                          the domain names containing the mark 'MEESHO'. Several bank accounts
                          are being publicised on such domain names/websites, and in one such
                          account, total transaction of more than Rs.53 lakhs was found by the Cyber
                          Crime Unit and an amount of only Rs.79/- was found to be remaining as
                          balance amount. Thus, domain name registration is becoming a tool for such
                          persons to collect monies through illegal means. It is under these
                          circumstances that the present order has been passed in respect of the DNR.
                          11.    It has also been brought to the notice of this Court that there are a
                          number of cases before the Court where fraudulent domain names are being
                          registered under the marks of well-known and established business houses

                          fraudulent websites with details of bank accounts under the garb of offering
                          jobs, dealerships, franchisees, lucky draws, and various other illegal
