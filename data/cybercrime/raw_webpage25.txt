4.14. On the basis of the above, it is contended

     that Snapdeal has put in place a robust

     system to inform all sellers on its platform

     of their responsibilities and obligations

     under       applicable     laws      and      therefore

     discharged its role and obligation as an

     intermediary.

                                16     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




4.15. It is contended that the above documents

    indicate    the    due      diligence    exercised     by

    Snapdeal      in        accordance       with    Section

    79(2)(c) of the Information Technology Act,

    2000,      read        in   conjunction      with     the

    Information        Technology           (Intermediaries

    Guidelines) Rules, 2011, in ensuring that

    Sellers who register on its Website conduct

    themselves        in    accordance       with   and     in

    compliance with the applicable laws.

4.17.7. On           21.05.2017,               Snapdeal

                      20      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020

        15.01.2020, Snapdeal replied to the

        Respondent.



4.17.10. On the basis of the above it is

        under    Section   18(c)    of    the   Act,
                           Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                21      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




which is punishable under Section

27(b)(ii) of the Act, which sections

are reproduced hereunder for easy

reference:


Section 18(c) :

                                  Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                        22     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




        times the value of the drugs confiscated,

        in the judgment, impose a sentence of
        imprisonment for a term of [less than three

4.17.11. As   regards    the    above,      criminal

        proceedings are initiated against the

        Petitioner in C.C. 156/2020 and vide

        order dated 08.06.2020, Cognisance

        Of offence under Section 27(b)(ii) is

        taken and Summons is issued to the

        Petitioners.


4.17.12. It is being aggrieved by the above

        Complaint       and     the      order      of

        Cognisance that the Petitioners are

        before this Court seeking for the

        aforesaid reliefs.
                                              Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                                   23      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020
5.   Shri   C   V   Nagesh       Learned    Senior      Counsel

     appearing for the Petitioners          while reiterating

     the contents of the petition submitted that:


     5.1. Even if all the contents of the Impugned

            Complaint are taken at their face value and

            accepted in their entirety, they do not prima

            facie   constitute    the   commission        of   an

            offence by the Petitioner.



     Order of Cognisance to be Speaking


     5.2. An order taking Cognisance is required to be

            done by way of a speaking order and the

            said order requires to be passed after due

            application of mind.


     5.3. The sine qua non for taking Cognisance of

            an offence is the application of mind by the

            Magistrate and his satisfaction that the

            allegations, if proved, would constitute an

            offence, in the present case, a mere
                                           Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                               24       & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




    perusal of the Impugned Order makes it

    abundantly clear that the                   same does

    not disclose application of mind.



5.4. He relied on the decision of the Apex

    Court in GHCL Employees Stock Option

    Trust v. India Infoline Limited (2013)

    4 SCC 505 more particularly para 19

    thereof which is reproduced hereunder for

    easy reference.


    19. In the order issuing Summons, the learned Magistrate
    has not recorded his satisfaction about the prima facie case
    as against Respondents 2 to 7 and the role played by them
    in the capacity of Managing Director, Company Secretary or
    Directors which is sine qua non for initiating criminal action
    against them. Recently, in Thermax Ltd. v. K.M. Johny
    while dealing with a similar case, this Court held as under:

           "38. Though Respondent 1 has roped all the
           appellants in a criminal case without their specific
           role or participation in the alleged offence with the
           sole purpose of settling his dispute with the appellant
           Company by initiating the criminal prosecution, it is
           pointed out that Appellants 2 to 8 are the ex-
           Chairperson, ex-Directors and senior managerial
           personnel of Appellant 1 Company, who do not have
           any personal role in the allegations and claims of
           Respondent 1. There is also no specific allegation
           with regard to their role.

           39. Apart from the fact that the Complaint lacks
           necessary ingredients of Sections 405, 406, 420 read
           with Section 34 IPC, it is to be noted that the concept
           of 'vicarious liability' is unknown to criminal law. As
                                         Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                              25      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




          observed earlier, there is no specific allegation made
          against any person but the members of the Board
          and senior executives are joined as the persons
          looking after the management and business of the
          appellant Company."

5.5. He relied on the decision of the Apex

    Court in M/s. Pepsi Foods Ltd and anr.

    vs. Special Judicial Magistrate and Ors

    (1998) 5 SCC 749, more particularly para 28

    thereof which is hereunder reproduced for

    easy reference:


    28. Summoning of an accused in a criminal case is a
    serious matter. Criminal law cannot be set into motion
    as a matter of course. It is not that the complainant
    has to bring only two witnesses to support his
    allegations in the Complaint to have the criminal law
    set into motion. The order of the Magistrate
    summoning the accused must reflect that he has
    applied his mind to the facts of the case and the law
    applicable thereto. He has to examine the nature of
    allegations made in the Complaint and the evidence
    both oral and documentary in support thereof and
    would that be sufficient for the complainant to succeed
    in bringing charge home to the accused. It is not that
    the Magistrate is a silent spectator at the time of
    recording of preliminary evidence before summoning of
    the accused. The Magistrate has to carefully scrutinise
    the evidence brought on record and may even himself
    put questions to the complainant and his witnesses to
    elicit answers to find out the truthfulness of the
    allegations or otherwise and then examine if any
    offence is prima facie committed by all or any of the
    accused.
                                           Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                             26         & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




5.6. A mere statement that the Court has gone

    through the Complaint,                documents and

    heard     the complainant is not sufficient.

    What     weighed        in    the       mind     of    the

    Magistrate while passing such an order

    must be reflected in his order.


5.7. That Section 204 of the Code contains the

    words "sufficient grounds for proceedings"

    which are of immense importance. It is

    these words which amply suggest that an

    opinion is to be formed only after due

    application of mind that there is sufficient

    basis    for    proceeding         against     the    said

    accused and formation of such an opinion

    is to be stated in the order itself, though

    the     order    need        not    contain      detailed

    reasons. In the present case, a mere

    perusal of the Impugned Order, makes it

    apparent        that   the         same      does      not
                                           Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                               27       & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




    disclose any application of mind for the

    purpose of coming to the conclusion as to

    why each of the             accused including the

    Petitioner      herein,     are     required       to   be

    proceeded          against.         When     there      are

    multiple accused, the order is required to

    disclose the application of mind by the

    Magistrate as regards each accused.



Role of an Intermediary under the Act


5.8. That     the      need       for   on     independent

    inquiry       as     per    the     requirements         of

    Section 202(1) Cr.P.C. is borne out by the

    fact    the     Court      of   the      Learned      Trial

    Court passed the Impugned Order without

    ascertaining (i) the role of Snapdeal in the

    sale of a product on its platform and (ii) the

    exact role of the Petitioners.
                                        Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                              28     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




5.9. Snapdeal is an intermediary as defined

     under Section 2(1)(w) of the Information

     Technology Act, 2000, as amended by the

     Information Technology (Amendment) Act,

     2008, and is therefore               entitled to     the

     exemption from liability in terms of Section

     79 Information Technology Act, 2000, for

     the following reasons:



5.10. Snapdeal      had      no    role    in   the      said

     transaction.



5.11. Snapdeal    merely      provides      access      to   a

     communication           system         over        which

     information      is   made     available      to   third

     parties.    In    the    present      instance,      the

     information regarding the products offered

     for sale by Accused No. 1 was enabled for

     display to the buyers/ customers on the
                                           Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                              29        & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020
     online    marketplace         of    Accused      No.     2

     Company.



5.12. Snapdeal as an intermediary has no control

     on what users may post on its platform.


5.13. Snapdeal     has    exercised        'due    diligence'

     under Section 79(2)(c) of the Information

     Technology Act, 2000, read in conjunction

     with       the      Information              Technology

     (Intermediaries      Guidelines)        Rules,       2011.

     Section 79(2)(c) of the IT Act is reproduced

     hereunder for easy reference:



     Section 79(2)(c) in The Information
     Technology Act, 2000
     (c) the intermediary observes due diligence
     while discharging his duties under this Act and
     also observes such other guidelines as the
     Central Government may prescribe in this
     behalf."


5.14. Intermediary       protection          provided        to

     Snapdeal         under   Section         79     of     the
                                      Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                            30     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020
Information Technology          Act,    2000 has

     been     acknowledged       by the Respondent

     in the    impugned      Complaint and           hence

     the Respondent could not have arrayed

     the      Petitioner    as    accused       in     the

     Complaint.


5.15. That the only liability of an intermediary

     under Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act is to

     take down third-party content upon receipt

     of either a court order, or a notice by an

     appropriate government authority and not

     otherwise. Section 79 of the IT Act is

     reproduced hereunder for easy reference:



     79 Exemption from liability of intermediary
     in certain cases.

     (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any law
     for the time being in force but subject to the
     provisions of sub-sections (2) and (3), an
     intermediary shall not be liable for any third party
     information, data, or communication link made
     available or hosted by him.
                                 Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                      31      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




(2) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall apply
if-

     (a) the function of the intermediary is
     limited   to   providing  access    to    a
     communication     system    over     which
     information made available by third parties
     is transmitted or temporarily stored or

     Delay in filing Complaint


5.20. The Complaint was filed with an inordinate

     delay   of   nearly     six    years,    though     the

     transaction occurred in the year 2014. No

     explanation        or   justification     has     been

     afforded     for    the       unreasonable       delay
                                         Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                             40       & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




    caused by the Respondent, and as such

    the same is fatal.



Sine Qua Non for 18(1)(c) of the Act



5.21. For 18(1)(c) of        the Act to apply it is

    imperative        that        a       person      either

    manufactures for sale or for distribution, or

    sells, or stocks or exhibits or offers for sale,

    any drug or cosmetic,             without a license

    issued under the Act. In the instant case,

    Snapdeal has neither manufactured for sale

    or    distribution,    nor    sold,    or stocked      or

    exhibited or offered          for sale, any drug or

    cosmetic. It is Accused No. 1, who exhibited

    and offered its products for sale on the

    Website      of    Snapdeal/Accused             No.     2

    Company. Hence neither Snapdeal nor its

    Directors the Petitioners can be made liable

    for    offences       punishable      under     Section
                                       Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                             41     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




     27(b)(ii)    of   the   Act.       The     essential

     ingredients of Section 18 (1)(c) of the Act

     not having been fulfilled neither Snapdeal

     nor    its    Directors/Petitioners        can     be

     prosecuted for the offence under Section

     27(b)(ii) of the Act.



Vicarious Liability of Directors in Criminal
Offences


5.22. Vicarious liability in criminal law is not

     automatic and that necessary averments

     ought to be contained in the Complaint

     before any person can be subjected to

     criminal process, in the instant case, there

     are no averments against the Petitioner.


5.23. The Petitioners are only Directors of the

     Company and are not involved in day to

     day affairs of the Company, like the sale

     of the products, which was done only by
                                      Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                            42     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




    Accused No. 1, therefore no offence can

    be alleged against them since they have

    no personal knowledge as to the legality

    or otherwise of the           products that are

    being sold by third-party sellers.


5.24. He relied upon the decision of the Apex

    court in in Maksud Saiyed vs. State of

    Gujurat,       (2008)     5   SCC       668     more

    particularly    para    13    thereof     which     is

    reproduced hereunder for easy reference:


    "13. Where a jurisdiction is exercised on a
    complaint petition filed in terms of Section 156(3)
    or Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
    the Magistrate is required to apply his mind. The
    Penal Code does not contain any provision for
    attaching vicarious liability on the part of the
    Managing Director or the Directors of the
    Company when the accused is the Company. The
    learned Magistrate failed to pose unto himself the
    correct question viz. as to whether the complaint
    petition, even if given face value and taken to be
    correct in its entirety, would lead to the conclusion
    that the respondents herein were personally liable
    for any offence. The Bank is a body corporate.
    Vicarious liability of the Managing Director and
    Director would arise provided any provision exists
    in that behalf in the statute. Statutes indisputably
    must contain provision fixing such vicarious
                                         Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                             43       & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




      liabilities. Even for the said purpose, it is
      obligatory on the part of the complainant to make
      requisite allegations which would attract the
      provisions constituting vicarious liability".


 5.25. Merely being a director is not sufficient to

      bring a person within the dragnet of a

      prosecution under Section 34 of the Act

      and that there is no deemed liability of

      directors for offences committed under

      the Act.


    Accused residing outside the jurisdiction
    of the Magistrate.


5.26. Section 202 of the Cr P.C, mandates that

      where      the   accused     resides   beyond      the

      jurisdiction of the Court, such court 'shall'

      postpone issuance of process and conduct

      an   inquiry      in   the     manner       provided

      thereunder, by relying on the decision of the

      Apex Court in Vijay Dhanka vs. Najima

      Momtaj,      (2014)     14     SCC      638,     more
                                     Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                         44       & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




particularly     Para    12    thereof     which     are

reproduced hereunder for easy reference:


12. The words "and shall, in a case where the accused
is residing at a place beyond the area in which he
exercises his jurisdiction" were inserted by Section 19
of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act
(Central Act 25 of 2005) w.e.f. 23-6-2006. The
aforesaid amendment, in the opinion of the legislature,
was essential as false complaints are filed against
persons residing at far off places in order to harass
them. The note for the amendment reads as follows:

"False complaints are filed against persons residing at
far off places simply to harass them. In order to see
that innocent persons are not harassed by
unscrupulous persons, this clause seeks to amend sub-
section (1) of Section 202 to make it obligatory upon
the Magistrate that before summoning the accused
residing beyond his jurisdiction he shall enquire into
the case himself or direct investigation to be made by
a police officer or by such other person as he thinks fit,
for finding out whether or not there was sufficient
ground for proceeding against the accused."

The use of the expression "shall" prima facie makes
the inquiry or the investigation, as the case may be,
by the Magistrate mandatory. The word "shall" is
ordinarily mandatory but sometimes, taking into
account the context or the intention, it can be held to
be directory. The use of the word "shall" in all
circumstances is not decisive. Bearing in mind the
aforesaid principle, when we look to the intention of
the legislature, we find that it is aimed to prevent
innocent persons from harassment by unscrupulous
persons from false complaints. Hence, in our opinion,
the use of the expression "shall" and the background
and the purpose for which the amendment has been
brought, we have no doubt in our mind that inquiry or
the investigation, as the case may be, is mandatory
before summons are issued against the accused living
beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the Magistrate.
                                                 Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                                      45      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




     5.27. All of the Accused, including the Petitioners,

             reside    beyond       the    jurisdiction     of      the

             Learned        Trial   Court.       Therefore,         the

             Impugned Order is ex facie illegal and is

             liable to be set aside since the same has

             been     passed        without      conducting         the

             mandatory enquiry as per Section 202 of

             the Cr.P.C.


6.    C.Nageshwarappa, learned HCGP on the other hand

      would submit that: Whether the Petitioner is a

      manufacturer or not, the fact that the Petitioner

      owns    market    place       Snapdeal     is    sufficient    to

      prosecute the Petitioner for any offence or violation

      committed by any seller on the platform.


      6.1. That the order of cognisance dated 8.6.2020

             passed    by    the    Magistrate    is    proper      and

             correct. The Magistrate cannot be expected to

             write a detailed order.             His prima facie

     satisfaction is sufficient for the purpose of

     taking cognizance, as also for issuance of

     summons. The order dated 8.6.2020 satisfies

     both the requirements and therefore, is not

     required to be interfered with.


6.2. In relation to the e-commerce transaction

     since    the    transaction     occurs      across    the

     country, it cannot be expected for a purchaser

     of a product in one part of the country to

     proceed against the e-commerce website only

     where it is registered and therefore, the

     Mysore Court where the item was ordered and

     delivered      could    exercise     jurisdiction.    The

     Mysore      Court      where   the    transaction     has

     occurred would have jurisdiction.


6.3. The fact of whether accused No.2 is registered

     outside the State of Karnataka or outside the

     jurisdiction of the Magistrate, as also whether

     accused Nos.3 and 4 are residing outside the
                                        Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                             47      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




     jurisdiction of the Magistrate is not relevant

     for   the   reason    that   the    transaction     has

     occurred     within    the    jurisdiction    of    the

     Magistrate at Mysore.        Therefore, there is no

     requirement to hold an enquiry under Section

     202(2) of Cr.P.C.


6.4. Irrespective   of     whether      accused   No.2     is

     considered as an intermediary or not, there

     could be no product which could have been

     advertised for sale contrary to the prohibitions

     under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.


6.5. Accused No.2 being the entity which provided

     a platform and permitted advertisement for

     sale of the said prohibited item, accused No.2

     and in turn accused Nos.3 and 4 being its

     directors are liable to be prosecuted. Neither

     accused No.2 nor accused Nos.3 and 4 can

     claim any benefit of being an intermediary as

     alleged or otherwise.
                                            Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                                  48     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




     6.6. There is no delay in filing of the complaint.

            The government entities have processed the

            matter, have taken necessary approval which

            took some time, therefore even if there is any

            delay, the said delay would not materially or

            adversely   affect   the   prosecution     of    the

            accused.


     6.7. On these basis, he submits that the petitions

            as filed are liable to be dismissed.


7.   Having heard Shri C V Nagesh the learned Senior

     counsel for the Petitioner and Shri Nageshwarappa

     learned HCGP, the points that would arise for

     determination by this Court are:


     (i)    Whether the order of Cognisance dated
            8.6.2020 complies with the requirement
            of Section 191(1)(a) of the Cr.P.C?

     (ii)   Whether Summons could have been
            ordered without following the procedure
            under Section 204 of Cr.P.C ?

     (iii) Whether the Magistrate could have
           issued Summons to accused Nos. 2 who
                                 Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                        49    & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




      is stated to be not registered within the
      Jurisdiction of the Magisterate without
      holding an enquiry under Section 202(1)
      of Cr.P.C.?

(iv) Whether the Magistrate could have
     issued Summons to the accused Nos. 3
     and      4     i.e.    petitioners    in
     Crl.P.No.4676/2020    since    they  are
     residing outside the jurisdiction of the
     Magistrate without holding an enquiry
     under Section 202(1) of Cr.P.C. ?

(v)   Which Court could exercise Jurisdiction
      as regards an offence relating to an e-
      commerce transaction?

(vi) Whether an intermediary as defined
     under Section 2(w) of the Information
     Technology Act would be liable for any
     action or inaction on party of a
     vendor/seller making use of the facilities
     provided by the intermediary in terms of
     a website or a market place?

(vii) Whether Snapdeal/accused No.2 would
      be responsible and/or liable for sale of
      any item not complying with the
      requirements under the Drugs and
      Cosmetics Act, 1949 on its platform
      accused No.2 being an intermediary?

(viii)Effect of delay   in   filing   a   Criminal
      Complaint?

(ix) What Order ?
                                        Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                               50    & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020
8.   I answer the above points as under.


9.   POINT NO. (i): Whether the order of
     Cognisance dated 8.6.2020 complies with the
     requirement of Section 191(1)(a) of the
     Cr.P.C?

     POINT NO. (ii): Whether Summons could have
     been ordered without following the procedure
     under Section 204 of Cr.P.C ?


     9.1. Both the above points being inter-related are

          taken up together.


     9.2. It is sought to be contended by relying on

          the decisions in GHCL Employees Stock

          Option Trust v. India Infoline Limited

          (2013) 4 SCC 505 and M/s. Pepsi

          Foods Ltd and anr. vs. Special Judicial

          Magistrate and Ors (1998) 5 SCC 749,

          that the Court taking Cognisance is required

          to apply its mind, which should be apparent

          from a reading of the order of Cognisance to

          indicate that the requirement of "sufficient
                                            Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                                 51      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




     grounds for proceedings" in terms of Section

     204 of the code has been complied with.



9.3. As held by the Hon'ble Apex Court as also this

     Court, any Court taking Cognisance of a

     matter is required to follow the due procedure

     relating     thereto      since     it    is      on     taking

     Cognisance that criminal law is set in motion

     as against the accused in that matter.                        For

     that     purpose,      at    the     time         of     taking

     Cognisance,        there     must         be      a      proper

     application of judicial mind to the materials

     before      the    said     Court        either        oral    or

     documentary, as well as any other information

     that might have been submitted or made

     available to the Court.



9.4. The test that is required to be applied by the

     Court      while   taking        Cognisance       is     as    to

     whether on the basis of the allegations made
                                     Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                           52     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




     in the Complaint or on a police report or on

     information furnished by a person other than

     a police officer, is there a case made out for

     initiation of criminal proceedings.



9.5. For     the   above   purpose,    there     is   an

     assessment of the allegations required to be

     made applying the law to the facts and

     thereby arriving at a conclusion by a process

     of reasoning that Cognisance is required to be

     taken.



9.6. An order of Cognisance cannot be abridged,

     formatted or formulaic. The said order has to

     make out that there is a judicial application of

     mind.     Since without such application, the

     same may result in the initiation of criminal

     proceedings when it was not required to be so

     done.
                                       Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                           53       & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




9.7. The order of taking Cognisance is a safeguard

     inbuilt in the criminal justice system so as to

     avoid malicious prosecution and/or frivolous

     complaints.



9.8. When a complaint or a police report or

     information by a person other than police

     officer is placed before the Court, the judicial

     officer must apply judicious mind coupled with

     discretion which is not to be exercised in an

     arbitrary, capricious, whimsical, fanciful or

     casual way.



9.9. Any offence alleged being one of commission

     or   omission     attracting     penal      statutes;

     Cognisance      can   be   taken     only     if   the

     allegations made fulfil the basic requirement

     of the said penal provision. At this point, it is

     not required for the Court taking Cognisance

     to ascertain the truth or veracity of the
                                       Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                          54        & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




    allegation   but   only    to   appreciate     if   the

    allegations taken at face value, would amount

    to the offence complained of or not. If Yes,

    Cognisance could be taken, if No, taking

    Cognisance could be refused. The only manner

    of ascertaining the above is by the manner of

    recordal made by the Court in the order taking

    Cognisance. The order passed by the court

    taking cognisance would therefore reflect such

    application of mind to the factual situation



9.10. In the above background that the order

    passed by the Magistrate taking Cognisance

    has to be appreciated. The said order reads as

    follows:


    "Persued entire records.

    Pursuant to which Cognisance is taken as
    against accused for the offence p/u/s
    27(b)(ii) of Drugs & Cosmetics Act.

    Office is hereby directed to register same
    as C.C. in register No.III.
                                     Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                          55      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




     Issuance summons to accused through
     R.P.A.D, if P/S, P/c along with other
     particular d/furn.

     Await & call on by 01/09/2020."



9.11. Applying the above requirement to the order

     passed by the Magistrate, it can be ex facie

     seen that the order of the Magistrate does not

     satisfy the requirement of arriving at a prima

     facie conclusion to take cognisance and issue

     process let alone to the accused residing

     outside the Jurisdiction of the said Magistrate.


9.12. There has to be an application of mind by the

     Court taking Cognisance that prima facie or

     exfacie the offences are made out on reading

     of the Complaint filed.       A perusal of the

     impugned order dated 8.6.2020 referred in

     the case that the Magistrate has perused the

     entire records pursuant to which he has taken

     Cognisance    as   against   the    accused      for
                                       Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                            56      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




     offences punishable under Section 27(b)(ii) of

     the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.                This

     order, in my considered opinion would not

     establish any application of mind on the part

     of the Magistrate inasmuch as there is no

     appreciation of the offence, the role of each of

     the accused and how they are alleged to have

     committed     the    offence   as    regards    which

     Cognisance is said to have been taken.


9.13. The same in my considered opinion would not

     satisfy the requirement of law. The Court

     taking Cognisance while taking Cognisance

     under Section 190 of Cr.P.C. is required to

     apply   its   mind    follow   the    process     and

     procedure prescribed under Section 204 of the

     Cr. P.C. and pass a sufficiently reasoned order

     indicating    such   application     of   mind,   the

     reasons for coming to a conclusion that prima

     facie there exists material to indicate that the
                                      Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                             57    & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




     offence alleged against the Accused is indeed

     committed by such accused.


9.14. Mere reference to the provisions in respect of

     which offences are alleged to have been

     committed would not be in compliance with

     the aforesaid requirement of the statutes as

     also the various decisions of the Honb'le Apex

     Court extracted hereinabove.

9.15. It is the words used in the order, which

     would have to suggest that the opinion to

     take Cognisance is formed only after due

     application of mind that there is sufficient

     basis    for    proceeding    against    the    said

     accused and formation of such an opinion

     is to be stated in the order itself, though

     the     order    need   not   contain      detailed

     reasons.
                                     Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                           58     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




9.16. In the present case, a mere perusal of the

     Impugned Order, makes it apparent that

     the     same     does      not   disclose       any

     application of mind for the purpose of

     coming to the conclusion as to why each

     of the     accused including the Petitioner

     herein, are      required    to be proceeded

     against.


9.17. When there are multiple accused, the

     order      is   required    to   disclose       the

     application of mind by the Court taking

     Cognisanse as regards each accused.


9.18. The Court taking Cognisance ought to have

     referred to and recorded the reasons why the

     said Court believes that an offence is made

     out so as to take Cognisance more so on

     account of the fact that it is on taking

     Cognisance that the criminal law is set in

     motion insofar as accused is concerned and
                                            Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                                 59      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




          there may be several cases and instances

          where if the Court taking Cognisance were to

          apply its mind, the Complaint may not even

          be   considered   by    the    said   Court    taking

          Cognisance let alone taking Cognisance and

          issuance of Summons.


     9.19. In view of the above, I am of the considered

          opinion   that   the   order   dated    08.06.2020

          taking Cognisance is not in compliance with

          applicable law and therefore is set aside.


9.20. I answer Point No. (i) and (ii) by holding that

     the order of Cognisance dated 8.6.2020 is not

     in compliance with the requirement of Section

     191(1)(a) of the Cr.P.C and further does not

     indicate the procedure under Section 204 of

     Cr.P.C having been followed. At the time of

     taking Cognisance and issuance of process,

     the Court taking Cognisance is required to

     pass a sufficiently detailed order to support
                                         Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                                 60   & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




      the conclusion to take cognisance and issue

      process, in terms of the discussion above. The

      judicious application of mind to the law and

      facts of the matter, should be apparent on the

      ex-facie reading of the order of Cognisance.



10.   POINT NO. (iii): Whether the Magistrate could
      have issued Summons to accused Nos. 2 who
      is stated to be not registered within the
      Jurisdiction of the Magisterate without holding
      an enquiry under Section 202(1) of Cr.P.C.?

                          And

      POINT NO. (iv) Whether the Magistrate could
      have issued Summons to the accused Nos. 3
      and 4 i.e. petitioners in Crl.P.No.4676/2020
      since they are residing outside the jurisdiction
      of the Magistrate without holding an enquiry
      under Section 202(1) of Cr.P.C. ?


      10.1. Both the above points being connected to

           each other are considered and answered

           together as under:


      10.2. Section 202 of Cr.P.C. is extracted hereunder

           for easy reference:
                                         Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                              61      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




     "202. Postponement of issue of process.-

    1. Any Magistrate, on receipt of a complaint of an
       offence of which he is authorised to take Cognisance
       or which has been made over to him under section
       192, may, if he thinks fit, postpone the issue of
       process against the accused, and either inquire into
       the case himself or direct an investigation to be
       made by a police officer or by such other person as
       he thinks fit, for the purpose of deciding whether or
       not there is sufficient ground for proceeding:
       Provided that no such direction for investigation shall
       be made,--

       a.   where it appears to the Magistrate that the
            offence complained of is triable exclusively by
            the Court of Session; or

       b.   where the Complaint has not been made by a
            Court, unless the complainant and the witnesses
            present (if any) have been examined on oath
            under section 200.


    2. In an inquiry under sub- section (1), the Magistrate
       may, if he thinks fit, take evidence of witnesses on
       oath: Provided that if it appears to the Magistrate
       that the offence complained of is triable exclusively
       by the Court of Session, he shall call upon the
       complainant to produce all his witnesses and
       examine them on oath.

    3. If an investigation under sub- section (1) is made by
       a person not being a police officer, he shall have for
       that investigation all the powers conferred by this
       Code on an officer- in- charge of a police station
       except the power to arrest without warrant.




10.3. A perusal of the Complaint indicates that the

     address of accused Nos.3 and 4 provided by

     the complainant himself is that of New Delhi.
                                         Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                               62     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020
     There is no address of accused Nos.3 and 4

     within the jurisdiction of the Magistrate at

     Mysuru which has been provided. A perusal of

     the entire Complaint also does not indicate

     any address or presence of accused Nos.3 and

     4 within the jurisdiction of the Magistrate in

     Mysuru.   The only allegation which has been

     made is that they are Directors of accused

     No.2-Snapdeal         Private        Limited        and

     proceedings have been initiated merely on the

     ground that Sri.C.M.Shivakumar, CW-9 vide

     his E-mail dated 29.08.2019 having informed

     about accused Nos.3 and 4 being Directors of

     accused      No.2,    there       has      been      no

     correspondence       by    the   complainant        that

     accused Nos.3 and 4 prior to the filing of the

     Complaint.

10.4. In so far as Snapdeal is concerned it is not

     registered within the Jurisdiction of the

     Magistrate.
                                      Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                            63     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




10.5. Admittedly all of the Accused reside beyond

     the Jurisdiction of the Learned Trial Court.


10.6. The protection under Section 202 (2) of the Cr

     P.C. is provided so as to not inconvenience an

     Accused to travel from outside the Jurisdiction

     of the Court taking Cognisance to attend to

     the matter in that Court. Therefore, before

     issuing Summons to an accused residing

     outside the Jurisdiction, there has to be an

     application of mind by the Court issuing

     Summons and after conducting an enquiry

     under Section 202 (2) of Cr.P.C. the Court

     issuing Summons has to come to a conclusion

     that such Summons are required to be issued

     to an accused residing outside its Jurisdiction.



10.7. Sri. Nageshwarappa, Learned HCGP submitted

     that   the   offence    of   sale   having        been

     committed    within    the   Jurisdiction    of    the
                                             Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                                  64      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




     Magistrate, it cannot be said that the accused

     is residing outside the Jurisdiction of the Court

     by contending that the Registered office of the

     Company is situate outside the Jurisdiction of

     the said Court.



10.8. Admittedly Snapdeal/Accused no.2 neither has

     a registered office within the Jurisdiction of

     the Magistrate nor does it have a branch

     office, corporate office, sales office or the like.


10.9. Section     202   of    Cr.P.C.       extracted     above

     provides for the safeguard in relation to

     persons not residing within the jurisdiction of

     the said Magistrate, not to be called or

     summoned by the said Court unless the

     Magistrate were to come to a conclusion that

     their      presence     is        necessary    and     only

     thereafter issue process against the accused.
                                          Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                               65      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




10.10. In the present case, as could be seen from the

      extract of the order dated 8.06.2020, the

      answer to point No.1 above, there is no such

      postponement made by the Magistrate, but as

      soon as the Magistrate received a complaint,

      he has issued process to accused No.2, who is

      registered     outside   the    jurisdiction    of   the

      Magistrate and also does not have any office

      within   the    territorial    Jurisdiction    of    the

      Magisterate.       Accused      Nos.3    and    4    are

      residing outside the jurisdiction of Magistrate

      and none of the accused Nos.2, 3 and 4 have

      any connection with any place within the

      jurisdiction of the Magistrate.


10.11. In view of the above, it was required for the

      Magisterate fo conduct a mandatory enquiry

      as per Section 202 (2) of the Cr.P.C.
                                        Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                              66     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




10.12. There being a violation of the requirement

      under Section 202 of Cr.P.C., I am of the

      considered opinion that the Magistrate could

      not have issued Summons to the petitioners in

      both   the    matters    without    following      the

      requirement     and     without    conducting      an

      enquiry under Section 202 of Cr.P.C. as held

      by the Apex court in Vijay Dhanka vs.

      Najima Momtaj, (2014) 14 SCC 638 as

      also by this court in        B.S.YEDIYURAPPA -

      vs-    State       of        Karnataka        [Crl.P.

      No.100964/2020 DD 11.09.2020].


10.13. I answer Point No. (iii) and (iv) by

      holding that :


10.14. When the accused is having an office,

      branch   office,      corporate     office,    sales

      office or the like within the Jurisdiction of

      the Magistrate where the offence has

      been committed and or continues to be
                                        Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                            67       & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




      committed,      there          would       be      no

      requirement     for      any    enquiry         under

      Section 202 of Cr.P.C. It would, however,

      be required for the Magistrate to in the

      order of issuance of summons/process

      record as to why the enquiry under

      Section 202 of Cr.P.C is not being held.



10.15. In   the   event   of      accused     being      an

      individual, if the said accused has a

      temporary       residence           within        the

      Jurisdiction   of     the    Magistrate,        again

      merely because he does               not have a

      permanent residence, there is no enquiry

      which is required to be conducted under

      Section 202 of Cr.P.C. It would, however,

      be required for the Magistrate to in the

      order of issuance of summons/process

      record as to why the enquiry under

      Section 202 of Cr.P.C is not being held.
                                  Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                          68   & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




10.16. When the accused has no presence within

     the Jurisdiction of the Magistrate where

     the offence has been committed, then it

     would be mandatory for an enquiry under

     Section 202 of the Cr.P.C to be held.



10.17. In the event of accused being aggrieved

     by the issuance of Summons, the said

     accused immediately on receipt of the

     Summons and/or on appearance before

     the Magistrate is required to make out his

     grievance before the Magistrate and/or

     by petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C.          If

     there is any delay, in such challenge

     and/or if challenge has not made within

     reasonable time, the accused would not

     be entitled to raise the grievance that the

     procedure under Section 202 of Cr.P.C.

     has not been followed on account of

     delay and latches.
                                           Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                                 69     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020
11.   Point No. (v): Which Court could exercise
      Jurisdiction as regards an offence relating to
      an e-commerce transaction?


      11.1. Whenever an offence is committed or alleged

           to have been committed, the first question of

           importance which arises is that in whose

           jurisdiction the offence would fall.


      11.2. The jurisdictional issue is for that reason the

           most important issue which needs to be

           resolved so that the proceedings can begin.

           Sections 177-189 of Cr. P.C deals with the

           concept    of    jurisdiction.   Under      normal

           circumstances, the case shall be inquired and

           tried by a court under whose jurisdiction the

           offence has been committed.


      11.3. However, there are certain cases where more

           than one Court could have the power to

           inquire into and try the matter. Such issues
                                         Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                              70      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




     have     been    explicitly    dealt       with    by    the

     provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.


11.4. In terms of Section 177 of the Cr. P.C, the

     Court under whose jurisdiction the offence has

     been     committed      only   has        the authority to

     inquire into and try such case.



11.5. It could be that an offence or a series of

     offences connected to the particular offence

     could     be    committed      at    different      place.

     Situations      where    the    offence       has       been

     committed in more than one place is dealt

     with by Section 178 of the Cr. P.C, this would

     arise for the reason that:



  11.5.1. The place of commission of the offence

             is uncertain because         it      has        been

             committed in several places.
                                    Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                          71     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




  11.5.2. Where an offence is partly committed in

          one local area and the rest in another

          area.

  11.5.3. When the offence comprises of several

          acts, committed in different local areas.



11.6. When an act is an offence because of anything

     which has been done and a consequence has

     ensued, the said offence may be inquired into

     or tried by a court of competent jurisdiction in

     terms of Section 179 of the Cr. P.C.


11.7. The place of trial when the Act committed is

     an offence because it is related to some other

     offence is as per Section 180 of the Cr. P.C.

     According to it the offence which has been

     committed first has to be inquired into or

     tried, when two acts are done in connection

     with each other and both are offences, by the

     Court under whose jurisdiction either of the
                                          Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                                  72   & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




     Act     has     been    committed.           In    all    such

     provisions, the emphasis is always on the

     place where the offence has been committed,

     to find the jurisdiction.


11.8. According to Section 181(1) of Cr. P.C, the

     trial   can also       be commenced               where     the

     accused is found, besides the place where the

     offence was committed and deals with the

     following cases.



  11.8.1. A murder committed while performing

             the Act of dacoity - where the offence is

             committed       or    where    the        accused    is

             found.


  11.8.2. Kidnapping or abduction of a person- the

             place    from    where        the    person       was

             kidnapped/       abducted       or        where     the

             person was concealed or conveyed or

             detained.
                                         Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                              73      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




  11.8.3. Theft, extortion or robbery - the Court

            where the offence has been committed

            or    where      the    stolen    property      is

            possessed, received or delivered, has the

            jurisdiction to try such a case.



  11.8.4. Criminal     misappropriation        or   criminal

            breach of trust- where the offence has

            been committed or where any part of the

            property which is the subject matter of

            the   offence     has    been     received     or

            retained, required to be returned or

            accounted for, by the accused.



11.9. Offences committed by letters etc., is dealt

     with    by    Section     182    of     the    Cr.   P.C

     whereunder, if any offence includes cheating,

     if the victim has been deceived by means of

     letters or telecommunication messages, it

     shall be looked into by the Court under whose
                                      Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                           74      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




      local jurisdiction such letters or messages

      have been sent or received; and under the

       local jurisdiction of the Court in which the

      property has been delivered by the person

      deceived or has been received by the accused

      person.


11.10. When a person commits an offence, during

      journey or against a person who is travelling,

      or the thing in respect of which, the offence

      has been committed is in due course of its

      journey or voyage, the offence has to be

      inquired into or tried by a Court through or

      into whose local jurisdiction that person or

      thing has passed, during the journey, in terms

      of Section 183 of Cr. P.C.



11.11. The   State   Government may       in   terms of

      Section 185 of the Cr. P.C direct that any

      cases or class of cases which have been
                                       Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                            75      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




      committed for trial in any district, may be

      tried in a sessions court.



11.12. In the event of Cognisance of a particular

      offence has been taken by two or more courts

      and confusion arises as to which of the Courts

      shall inquire into or try that offence, in such a

      case, in terms of Section 186 of the Cr. P.C

      only the High Court has the authority to

      resolve the confusion.



11.13. A Magistrate can issue Summons or warrant

      for   offences   which have     been committed

      beyond his local jurisdiction and has authority

      to order such a person to be produced before

      him and then send him to the Magistrate of

      competent jurisdiction, in terms of Section

      187 of the Cr. P.C.
                                    Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                          76     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




11.14. The present case is one of an unauthorised

      sale or sale of a prohibited item. The present

      case is not one of Cyber Crime.



11.15. In the present case is not that there was a

      sale of a product physically, meaning that the

      product was not handed over immediately on

      sale. If that were so, jurisdictional matters

      would be very simple in that the Court where

      the physical transaction happened would have

      Jurisdiction.



11.16. In the present case as in all e-commerce

      transactions, the sale took place on the

      internet, in that once the product was put up

      for sale on the marketplace, anyone could

      have bought the same from any place so long

      as the product could be delivered at the place

      where the buyer was located. A buyer could

      also place an order from one place and get the
                                         Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                               77     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




      product delivered at another. It is for this

      reason that the concept of Jurisdiction of

      courts   in     e-commerce      transactions      gets

      complicated.



11.17. In so far as civil matters are concerned the

      courts have over a period of time developed

      several tests to determine as to which court

      could have jurisdiction, the tests as regards a

      criminal matter would be different. Essentially

      when     a    criminal   prosecution     is   initiated

      against a person or entity, such person or

      entity   cannot    be    made    to    face   such    a

      prosecution at any place within the country or

      outside. The Court having jurisdiction should

      be determined in such a manner that neither

      the complainant nor an accused is put to

      unnecessary harassment.
                                        Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                             78      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




11.18. In a prosecution for criminal offences, white

      collared or otherwise the accused is required

      to be present physically on each date of

      hearing, so long as such appearance is not

      exempted. As such the court would have to

      protect    the   accused     from   possible   forum

      shopping and or from complaints being filed in

      multiple    jurisdictions,   which    could    cause

      undue harassment to such an e-commerce

      entity.



11.19. Therefore I answer point no. (v) by

      holding that only a Court in which the

      accused has a presence, like registered

      office, branch office, corporate office or

      the like could exercise Jurisdiction as

      regards an offence relating to an e-

      commerce transaction.
                                           Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                                 79     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




      11.20. This of course would not apply to a Cyber

            Crime,     which    comes        under     global

            jurisdiction according to the IT Act, 2000.

            This     means     that    any     cyber-crime

            complaint can be registered with any of

            the cyber cells in India, irrespective of

            where      the     crime    was       originally

            committed.


12.    Point No. (vi): Whether an intermediary as
       defined under Section 2(w) of the Information
       Technology Act would be liable for any action
       or inaction on party of a vendor/seller making
       use of the facilities provided by the
       intermediary in terms of a website or a market
       place?


  12.1. It is stated that Snapdeal has established a a

            Marketplace on the World Wide Web, more

            popularly known as the internet, enabling a

            Seller to upload, sell or even 'offer for sale'

            any product on Snapdeal. For this purpose,

            a seller   h as to create an account with
                                                  Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                                     80        & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




        Snapdeal           and     contractually          agree     to

        Snapdeal's         Terms          of    Use,      Snapdeal's

        Terms        of    Offer     for       Sale,      Snapdeal's

        Policies, Seller Agreement: which contains

        the basic terms and conditions                     of selling

        products over Snapdeal which every Seller

        has to agree with.


12.2. Snapdeal's business as per its 'Terms of

        Offer        for    Sale',    is       "a   platform      that

        facilitates the online sale and purchases of

        branded            merchandise              and     services

        ("Services") offered by Snapdeal's various

        affiliate/    registered          merchants/        vendors/

        service providers ("Vendor/s").



12.3.   Snapdeal being an intermediary can not be

        disputed, it comes with the meaning and

        definition of Intermediary under                     Section

        2(1)(w) of the Information Technology Act,
                                              Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                                81         & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




        2000,     as   amended        by    the    Information

        Technology       (Amendment)              Act,        2008.

        Snapdeal       would     be        entitled      to     the

        exemption from liability in terms of Section

        79 Information Technology Act, 2000 if the

        requirements thereof are met.


12.4.   Snapdeal is not the Seller, it is the Vendors

        registered     with    Snapdeal        who       are    the

        Sellers of products and services on its

        platform, it is the Vendors who are solely

        responsible to the purchaser/customer.



12.5.   For its part Snapdeal has entered into seller

        agreements with various sellers, the seller

        agreements are accompanied by a Schedule

        of banned products,            which categorically

        includes "21. Prescription Medicines and

        Drugs".
                                       Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                             82     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




12.6.   The Seller Agreement, details out the terms

        and conditions relevant to the transaction,

        which are extracted hereinabove.



12.7.   Snapdeal has also published a document titled

        'Prohibited Seller Activities and consequences

        Policy Document', where one of the Prohibited

        seller activities is clearly specified to be the

        sale of the drug subject matter of the present

        criminal proceedings.


12.8.   It cannot be expected that the provider or

        enabler of the online marketplace is aware

        of all the products sold on its Website. It

        is only required that such provider or

        enabler put in place a robust system to

        inform all sellers on its platform of their

        responsibilities   and    obligations       under

        applicable laws in order to discharge its

        role and obligation as an intermediary. If
                                             Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                                   83     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




        the same is violated by the Seller of

        goods     or   service       such     seller    can   be

        proceeded with but not the intermediary.



12.9.   The manner in which the above documents

        have been executed, contents thereof as

        also the obligation of the parties stated

        therein     establishes         the   due       diligence

        exercised      by     Snapdeal         to       be     in

        accordance with and compliance of Section

        79(2)(c) of the Information Technology Act,

        2000,     read      in     conjunction         with   the

        Information         Technology        (Intermediaries

        Guidelines) Rules, 2011, in ensuring that

        Vendors/Sellers who register on its Website

        conduct themselves in accordance with and

        in compliance with the applicable laws.



12.10. The   Consumer            Protection    (E-Commerce)

        Rules, 2020, makes a distinction between
                                           Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                                 84     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




      marketplace e-commerce websites                      and

      inventory e-commerce websites. As such

      Snapdeal would come within the meaning of

      a marketplace e-commerce website, thereby

      affording the above exemption to Snapdeal

      so long as the requirements under section

      79 are followed by Snapdeal.



12.11. In the   present         case   as   detailed     above

      Snapdeal has complied with the requirements

      of sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 79, as

      well    as    the         Information      Technology

      (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011.



12.12. In my considered opinion Snapdeal has

      exercised    'due        diligence'   under      Section

      79(2)(c) of the Information Technology Act,

      2000,     read      in     conjunction      with     the

      Information      Technology           (Intermediaries

      Guidelines) Rules, 2011.
                                          Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                              85       & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




12.13. When Snapdeal/Accused to. 2 Company is

       exempted from any liability under Section

       79   of   the    Information      Technology       Act,

       2000, no violation can ever be attributed or

       made out against the directors or officers

       of the intermediary, as the same would be

       only vicarious, and such proceedings as

       initiated against them would be unjust

       and bad in law.



12.14. The only liability of an intermediary under

       Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act is to take

       down third-party content upon receipt of

       either a court order or a notice by                 an

       appropriate government authority and not

       otherwise, which as per the Complaint filed

       indicates   has      been   complied        with    by

       Snapdeal,       by   removing     the    information

       regarding the sale of the offending item.
                                           Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                                 86     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




  12.15. I answer Point No. (vi) by holding that an

           intermediary as defined under Section

           2(w) of the Information Technology Act

           or its directors/officers would not be

           liable for any action or inaction on part of

           a   vendor/seller     making      use     of      the

           facilities provided by the intermediary in

           terms of a website or a market place.


13.   POINT NO. (vii): Whether Snapdeal/accused
      No.2 would be responsible and/or liable for
      sale of any item not complying with the
      requirements under the Drugs and Cosmetics
      Act, 1949 on its platform accused No.2 being
      an intermediary?


      13.1. Section   18(1)(c)   of   the      Drugs         and

           Cosmetics     Act,    1949      applies      to     a

           manufacturer of a drug or cosmetic, coming

           within the perview and ambit of the Act.

           Such manufacture is also required to be for
                                   Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                         87     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




     sale or for distribution of any drug or

     cosmetic.


13.2. The only allegation in the present matter is

     as regards Snapdeal having made available

     its platform for sale by Accused No.1 of a

     drug. There are no allegation that Snapdeal

     has   either   manufactured     for    sale     or

     distributed or sold, or stocked or exhibited

     or offered for sale, any drug or cosmetic.



13.3. Though the platform is owned and operated

     by Snapdeal it is Accused No. 1, who has

     exhibited and offered its products for sale

     on the Snapdeal's platform. Snapdeal being

     an intermediary is exempt from criminal

     prosecution as aforestated.



13.4.In this background neither Snapdeal nor its

     Directors can be or made liable for alleged
                                             Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                                  88      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




           offences punishable under Section 27(b)(ii)

           of the Drug and Cosmetics Act.



      13.5. Hence I answer Point No. (vii) by holding

           that Snapdeal/accused No.2 would not be

           responsible and/or liable for sale of any

           item      not      complying           with       the

           requirements       under       the     Drugs     and

           Cosmetics Act, 1949 on its platform by

           accused     No.1       since     the     essential

           ingredients of Section 18 (1)(c) of the

           Act not having been fulfilled neither

           Snapdeal     nor      its   Directors      can     be

           prosecuted      for     the     offence        under

           Section 27(b)(ii) of the Act.


14.   Point No. (viii): Effect of delay in filing a
      Criminal Complaint?


      14.1. The object and essence of prompt lodging of

           FIR had been explained by the Hon'ble Apex
                                      Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                           89      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




  Court in State of Andhra Pradesh vs M.

  Madhusudhan Rao (2008) 15 SCC 582,

  observed as under:


14.1.1. That delay in lodging the FIR, more often

        than not, results in embellishment and

        exaggeration, which is a creature of an

        afterthought.



14.1.2. That a delayed report not only gets

        bereft of the advantage of spontaneity,

        the   danger       of    the     introduction   of

        coloured version, exaggerated account of

        the incident or a concocted story as a

        result of deliberations and consultations,

        also creeps in, casting a serious doubt

        on its veracity.



14.1.3. Therefore, it is essential that the delay in

        lodging     the         report      should      be
                                        Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                             90      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




            satisfactorily   explained.       Resultantly,

            when the substratum of the evidence

            given by the complainant is found to be

            unreliable, the prosecution case has to

            be rejected in its entirety.


14.2. It is in that background that there is required

     to be a Prompt and early reporting of the

     incident by the informant with all its vivid

     details gives an assurance regarding its true

     version. In case, there is some delay in filing

     the    FIR,   the   complainant     must      give    an

     explanation for the same.


14.3. In Sahib Singh v. State of Haryana (AIR

     1997 SC 3247) and Gorge Pentaiah v.

     State of A.P. & Ors. (2008) 12 SCC 531 it

     has been held that delay in lodging the FIR

     does    not    make     the    complainant's         case

     improbable     when     such    delay    is   properly

     explained. However, deliberate           delay         in
                                          Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                                91     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




     lodging the Complaint may prove to be fatal.

     In such cases the Court has to carefully

     examine the facts before it, for the reason,

     that    the     complainant      party   may     initiate

     criminal proceedings just to harass the other

     side with mala fide intentions or with ulterior

     motive         of     wreaking     vengeance.        The

     proceedings before a court ought not to be

     permitted to degenerate into a weapon of

     harassment and persecution. In cases, where

     an FIR is lodged clearly with a view to spite

     the other party because of a private and

     personal grudge and to enmesh the other

     party     in        long   and    arduous       criminal

     proceedings, the Court may take a view that it

     amounts to an abuse of the process of law.



14.4. In the present case the Complaint was filed

     with an inordinate delay of nearly six years,
                                     Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                          92      & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




     though the transaction is stated to have

     occurred in the year 2014.



14.5. In   the   Complaint     filed   there     is   no

     explanation or justification w h i c h           has

     been given for the unreasonable delay

     caused by the Respondent, more so when

     the     Respondent/Complainant             is      a

     government official.


14.6. Such a delay would result in arriving at a

     rebuttable presumption that there was no

     offence committed.



14.7. Even if there may be no embellishments,

     criminal    proceedings   cannot    be    initiated

     after a period of 6 years, irrespective of the

     applicability of limitation period in terms of

     Section 468 of the Cr. P.C or not. The only

     excuse for the delay provided is that the

     complainant being a government employee
                                              Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                                  93       & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




           the process of obtaining permission to file

           the    complaint     took    some     time.     In    my

           considered opinion a period of 6 years

           cannot be said to be some time. It is

           required for the state to act with alacrity,

           the fact that there was a delay of 6 years in

           filing would itself indicate and/or establish

           that    even   the     authorities        might      have

           probably considered that there is no offence

           as such made out.



      14.8. In    the   present        case,    I'am       of    the

           considered opinion that there being no

           acceptable     explanation          for   the     highly

           belated lodging of the Complaint, the

           delay is fatal to these proceedings.

15.   What Order:


16.   The answers to the above points formulated are

      summarised as under:
                                         Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                           94         & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




16.1. The order of Cognisance dated 8.6.2020

    is not in compliance with the requirement

    of Section 191(1)(a) of the Cr.P.C and

    further does not indicate the procedure

    under Section 204 of Cr.P.C having been

    followed.     At     the         time      of     taking

    Cognisance and issuance of process, the

    Court taking Cognisance is required to

    pass   a    sufficiently     detailed       order      to

    support      the     conclusion             to      take

    cognisance and issue process, in terms of

    the    discussion     above.         The        judicious

    application of mind to the law and facts

    of the matter, should be apparent on the

    ex-facie     reading        of     the      order      of

    Cognisance.



16.2. When the accused is having an office,

    branch     office,   corporate          office,    sales

    office or the like within the Jurisdiction of
                                       Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                           95       & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




     the Magistrate where the offence has

     been committed and or continues to be

     committed,      there          would       be      no

     requirement     for      any    enquiry         under

     Section 202 of Cr.P.C. It would, however,

     be required for the Magistrate to in the

     order of issuance of summons/process

     record as to why the enquiry under

     Section 202 of Cr.P.C is not being held.



16.3. In   the   event   of      accused     being      an

     individual, if the said accused has a

     temporary       residence           within        the

     Jurisdiction   of     the    Magistrate,        again

     merely because he does               not have a

     permanent residence, there is no enquiry

     which is required to be conducted under

     Section 202 of Cr.P.C. It would, however,

     be required for the Magistrate to in the

     order of issuance of summons/process
                                Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                        96   & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




    record as to why the enquiry under

    Section 202 of Cr.P.C is not being held.


16.4. When the accused has no presence within

    the Jurisdiction of the Magistrate where

    the offence has been committed, then it

    would be mandatory for an enquiry under

    Section 202 of the Cr.P.C to be held.



16.5. In the event of accused being aggrieved

    by the issuance of Summons, the said

    accused immediately on receipt of the

    Summons and/or on appearance before

    the Magistrate is required to make out his

    grievance before the Magistrate Court

    and/or by petition under Section 482

    Cr.P.C.    If there is any delay, in such

    challenge and/or if challenge has not

    made      within   reasonable    time,      the

    accused would not be entitled to raise the
                                        Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                              97     & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




      grievance      that    the    procedure       under

      Section    202 of Cr.P.C. has not been

      followed on account of delay and latches.


16.6. Only a Court in which the accused has a

      presence, like registered office, branch

      office, corporate office or the like could

      exercise    Jurisdiction       as    regards       an

      offence     relating     to   an     e-commerce

      transaction.


16.7. This of course would not apply to a Cyber

      Crime,     which       comes        under     global

      jurisdiction according to the IT Act, 2000.

      This     means        that    any     cyber-crime

      complaint can be registered with any of

      the cyber cells in India, irrespective of

      where      the        crime    was       originally

      committed.
                                 Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                         98   & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




16.8. An intermediary as defined under Section

     2(w) of the Information Technology Act

     or its directors/officers would not be

     liable for any action or inaction on part of

     a   vendor/seller   making    use     of    the

     facilities provided by the intermediary in

     terms of a website or a market place.


 16.9. An intermediary would not be responsible

     and/or liable for sale of any item not

     complying with the requirements under

     the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1949 on its

     platform since the essential ingredients

     of Section 18 (1)(c) of the Act not

     having been fulfilled. Neither Snapdeal

     nor its Directors can be prosecuted for

     the offence under Section 27(b)(ii) of

     the Act.


16.10. There being no acceptable explanation

     for the highly belated lodging of the
                                      Crl.P. No.4676 of 2020
                             99    & Crl.P. No.4712 of 2020




          Complaint, the delay is fatal to these

          proceedings.


17.   In the result, both the petitions are allowed.

      The proceedings in C.C.No.156/2020 pending

      before the Court of the Principal Senior Civil

      Judge and CJM, Mysuru are quashed.
