15.   It is pertinent to note here that, in the instant case admittedly

the accused is facing the trial for the offence punishable under

section 67(B) of the Information Technology Act and under section

201 of the Indian Penal Code.

      It is pertinent to note here that, the special rules of proof in

criminal case are that -(1) there is presumption of innocence of the

accused till the contrary is proved, (2) that the burden of proof lies

on the prosecution and (3) the guilt of the accused should be proved

to a moral certainty beyond any reasonable doubt.

      It is pertinent to note here that, to bring home the charge

under section 67(B) of the Information Technology Act, the
 10                                             C.C.No.14616/2014

prosecution must prove that the accused has published or

transmitted material in any electronic form which depicts children

engaged in sexually explicit act or conduct; or created text digital

images, collected, browsed, downloaded, advertised, exchanged or

distributed material in any electronic form depicting children in

obscene or indecent or sexually explicit manner; or facilitated abusing

children online, or the recorded in any electronic form own abuse or

that of others pertaining to sexually explicit act with children; or

cultivated, enticed or induced children to online relationship with one

or more children for and on sexually explicit act or in a manner that

may offend a reasonable adult on the computer resource.

     It is pertinent to note here that, to constitute the offence

punishable under section 201 of Indian Penal code, it must be proved

that the accused has actively participated in the matter of causing

disappearance of evidence. It is to be noted here that, the proof of

an offence is an essential requisite for bringing home the offence

under section 201 of the Indian Penal Code. It is pertinent to note

here that, on examination of deposition by witnesses, no evidence
 11                                                  C.C.No.14616/2014

showed that the accused has committed the offence, the accused is

liable to be acquitted.

16.   It is pertinent to note here that, the prosecution in the instant

case has failed to prove the essential requisites of aforesaid

provisions.   It is pertinent to note here that, the evidence of PWs1

to 9 is not crystal clear from which it can be held that the accused

had   viewed,    accessed     and   downloaded       the    offensive   child

pornography materials by means of his aforesaid computer and with

an intention to destroy the evidence had sold out his computer

accessories to some unknown person. It is pertinent to note here

that, mere allegation is not suffice to hold that the accused has

committed the alleged offences. It is pertinent to note here that, in

other words, in present case on examination of deposition of

witnesses, no evidence is forth coming that the accused has

committed the alleged offences. It is to be noted here that, in view

of My above findings and without much discussion I hold that, the

prosecution has utterly failed to prove the guilt of the accused for the

offence   punishable      under   section   67(B)    of    the   Information
 12                                              C.C.No.14616/2014
Technology Act and under section 201 of the Indian Penal Code. In

view of the same, points no.1 and 2 are answered in the NEGATIVE.

17. Point No.3:- That, as discussed on points no.1 and 2, I proceed

to pass the following,

                               ORDER

      That, acting under section 248(1) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure, accused is acquitted for the offence punishable under

section 67(B) of the Information Technology Act and under section

201 of the Indian Penal Code.

     That, the bail and surety bonds of the accused are stands

cancelled.

     That, the accused shall comply with the provisions of section

437(A) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

     That, M.O.1 shall be destroyed after appeal period.
