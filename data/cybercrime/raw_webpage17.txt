Rajesh Bindal J.
1.          The present proceedings pertain to the notice issued by this
court on 28.9.2011 to accused Rajesh Kumar (hereinafter referred to as 'the
accused') for cancellation of bail granted to him by Additional Sessions
Judge, Bathinda on 23.3.2011.
2.          The accused herein is involved in following cases along with
other persons, who include his family members:
            (i)     FIR No. 221 dated 17.9.2010, under Sections 420, 120-B
                    IPC, 4, 5 and 6 of the Prize Chest and Money Circulation
                    Scheme Act, 1978, Police Station, Mansa.
            (ii)    FIR No. 3 dated 5.1.2012, under Section 420 IPC, Police
                    Station, Kotwali, Patiala.
            (iii)   FIR No. 91 dated 2.4.2011, under Section 306 IPC,
                    Police Station, City Rajpura.
 CRM No. 10956 of 2012                                                          [2]

               (iv)     FIR No. 199 dated 5.12.2010, under Sections 420, 120-B
                        IPC, Police Station Model Town, Ludhiana.
               (v)      FIR No. 140 dated 14.11.2010, under Sections 420, 120-
                        B IPC, Police Station, Civil Line, Bathinda.
3.            The accused in connivance with other accused named in the
FIRs is primarily running a chit fund company, whereby they allegedly
cheated lot of small time investors of their hard earned money. The
transactions in the accounts of the company and the accused are running
into crores of rupees, which were deposited and withdrawn. The details
thereof, as furnished in the affidavit of Manmeet Singh, PPS, Deputy
Superintendent of Police, State Cyber Crime Police Station, SAS Nagar
dated 29.5.2013, are extracted below:
      "Sr. Name of Bank           Amount deposited in         Amount              Balance
       No.                        rupees (approximate)        withdrawal          (in rupees)
                                                              (in rupees)

             Total:                   37,00,44,448/-             35,63,97,209/- 1,36,47,239/-
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"


4.            The issue came up for consideration before this court in four
separate applications for anticipatory bail filed by different accused in FIR
No. 140 dated 14.11.2010, under Sections 420, 120-B IPC, registered at
Police Station, Civil Lines, Bathinda. The other accused named in the FIR
are wife, sister and          two sons of two different sisters.                     As the return
promised to the investors was not granted and the money was not returned
back, the FIR in question was registered. During the course of hearing of
the aforesaid four anticipatory bail applications, it transpired that in the
accounts maintained by the company and the accused, crores of rupees were
deposited and transferred in some other accounts. Some of the withdrawals
running into crores of rupees were made by the accused themselves. The
investigation in the present case had not been carried out properly to find
 CRM No. 10956 of 2012                                      [3]

out the accounts in which crores of rupees had been transferred and the
accused had been granted bail. As has been noticed above, the accused was
involved in five cases registered at different places. Apparently, all these
facts were not brought to the notice of the courts where different cases were
pending pointing out the gravity of the offence committed by the accused
and also his conduct.
5.          While declining pre-arrest bail to the other accused in the FIR,
this court issued notice to accused Rajesh Kumar to show cause as to why
bail already granted to him be not cancelled by observing as under:
            "The information as is available with the learned State counsel
            on instructions from SI Mohan Singh, shows that transfers
            running into crores of rupees, as has been noticed above, have
            not been explained. The accused Rajesh Kumar, even after his
            arrest, apparently was not asked as to whom the money was
            transferred. Investigating Officer is not aware of the identity of
            Jaivir in whose account 30 lacs were transferred. Apparently
            investigation is shady and challan has also not been presented
            till date. There are two other FIRs against the accused. The
            order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Bathinda dated
            23.3.2011 granting bail to Rajesh Kumar has been produced in
            Court. It has been mentioned therein that he was arrested on
            5.2.2011 and is no more required by the Investigating Agency
            for further interrogation or recoveries, whereas from the facts
            which have been projected before the Court it is evident that
            proper investigation had not been carried out. The Court below
            was not even apprised of the fact that Rajesh Kumar is accused
            in two other FIRs registered against him at Mansa and
            Ludhiana. Apparently the amount involved in the case was also
            not brought before the Court as he was directed to be released
            merely on furnishing of personal bonds of ` 50,000/- with one
            surety of the same amount. It is not known to the Investigating
            Officer present in Court today as to whether Rajesh Kumar was
            arrested in other two FIRs registered against him with similar
 CRM No. 10956 of 2012                                     [4]

             allegations or not.
                     Let a notice be issued to Rajesh Kumar son of Raghubir
             Singh, resident of village Balsamand, Police Station Sadar,
             Hisar, District Hisar as to why bail granted to him by the
             learned Additional Sessions Judge, Bathinda on 23.3.2011 be
             not cancelled for 1.11.2011."
6.           On 21.5.2012, noticing that the accused is stated to be in
custody in Central Jail, Patiala in FIR No. 91 dated 2.4.2011, registered
under Section 306 IPC at Police Station Rajpura City, it was directed that
the accused shall not be released in case he is already in custody. On
11.10.2012, the court was informed that the accused had been released from
custody in the aforesaid case despite restraint order by this court. Though
this court restrained release of the accused from custody on 21.5.2012,
however, as is evident from the facts of the case, the order passed by this
court was not brought to the notice of the court concerned and he was
granted bail on 28.5.2012 and was released on the same day. Even the
accused, who was duly represented through a counsel before this court, did
not point out before the court concerned that there is a restraint on his
release from jail.
7.           As the accused had been released after passing of restraint
order by this court, the Investigating Officer was directed to take him in
custody before taking up the case for cancellation of bail. Then started the
race of cat and mouse. The accused absconded. It was pointed out before the
court that he was involved in five criminal cases registered at different
places. When all efforts made by the Investigating Agency to arrest the
accused remained futile, on 31.1.2013, this court noticed the facts that the
accused is involved in five different cases, in two of them the accused had
misused the concession of bail where non-bailable warrants had been issued
against him and further that in one of the FIRs, where the accused was to
appear, an application was filed for exemption from personal appearance,
which was allowed irrespective of the fact that non-bailable warrants had
been issued against the accused in other cases. This was apparently for the
reason that it was not pointed out to all the courts concerned by       the
 CRM No. 10956 of 2012                                       [5]

Investigating Agency that he was involved in other cases and further his
conduct in those cases, which is always relevant for the purpose of
consideration of anticipatory or regular bail application of an accused or
even at the stage of conviction or sentence. There is either lapse or
connivance or no system in place of which undue benefit is being taken by
the accused.
8.             On the aforesaid date of hearing, learned counsel for the
complainant produced before the court copies of various accounts
maintained by the company and the accused in different banks. The banks
maintaining the accounts of the company and the Directors thereof were
restrained from permitting any transaction except with the permission of the
Court.
9.             On 27.2.2013, learned counsel for the State pointed out that a
sum of ` 1,19,00,000/- was found lying in various bank accounts
maintained by the company and the accused. He sought time to find out in-
flow and out-flow of money from various accounts maintained by the
company and all the accused involved therein. Considering the fact that
apparently number of small investors had been cheated and the matter
required examination of accounts, Director General of Police, Punjab was
directed to consider transfer of investigation of the case to any other wing.
On the next date of hearing, it was submitted that investigation of the FIR
has been transferred to Crime Wing under the direct supervision of
DIG/Cyber Crime.
10.            On 2.4.2013, learned counsel for the State pointed out that the
Investigating Agency has been able to find out the details of various
accounts maintained by other accused in the FIR. This Court directed
seizure of all the accounts and further conversion of the amounts lying
therein in FDRs.        It was only thereafter that accused-Rajesh Kumar
surrendered in the court on 8.4.2013 and presently is in custody.
11.            The other two accused, namely, wife and sister of accused-
Rajesh Kumar never joined investigation and they have been declared
proclaimed offenders. It is in the aforesaid factual matrix that the case of
accused-Rajesh Kumar is to be considered for cancellation of bail.
 CRM No. 10956 of 2012                                       [6]



12.           The contention of learned counsel for accused-Rajesh Kumar is
that in the FIR in question, he was arrested on 5.2.2011 and after 46 days in
custody was released on regular bail on 23.3.2011. Finally, he was released
from jail on 28.5.2012 after he got bail in other cases as well. Thereafter, he
did not put in appearance in any case and surrendered on 8.4.2013 and is in
custody since then. The details of all the accounts were with the
Investigating Officer. The charge against the accused is yet to be proved.
No evidence has been led. The accused has not violated any of the
conditions of bail or tampered with the evidence. There are different para-
meters for grant or cancellation of bail. The accused is ready to furnish any
surety.
13.           On the other hand, learned counsel for the State and the
complainant     submitted that the accused is involved in five different
criminal cases involving cheating poor public. He has squandered crores of
rupees by cheating poor public of their hard-earned money. Considering his
conduct, where he did not put in appearance before the court for a period of
more than 10 months and further surrendered only after all his accounts
were seized, he does not deserve any sympathy and the concession of bail
already granted to him deserves to be cancelled.
14.           Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the paper
book.
15.           It is a case where the accused took full benefit of lapse on the
part of the Investigating Agency or there being no system in place for
sharing of    data pertaining to an accused. Accused-Rajesh Kumar was
involved in five different cases registered at different places involving
similar offence. In none of the cases, it was pointed out before the court that
he is involved in other case which could be a relevant factor for grant or
refusal of concession of bail. Because of lapse he was granted exemption
from personal appearance in one case, whereas in others, he had been
declared proclaimed offender. His conduct was also not brought before the
court. The investigation of the crime had also not been upto the mark. No
efforts were made to find out as to where the amount collected from poor
 CRM No. 10956 of 2012                                       [7]

public was deposited and ultimately transferred. Even after registration of
the FIR, substantial amount was withdrawn from the accounts of the
company as well as the accused. The figures, as given in the affidavit of
Manmeet Singh, Deputy Superintendent of Police, State Cyber Crime Police
Station, SAS Nagar dated 29.5.2013 show that for the period the accounts
were checked by the Investigating Agency, more than ` 37 crores were
deposited in different accounts maintained at different places, out of which
entire amount was withdrawn or transferred to different accounts and only `
1.36 crores remained balance. As to in which account the amount was
transferred was not investigated properly to find out the beneficiaries. The
crime committed by the accused was taken quite lightly, may be because the
complainants were small time investors. No holistic view was taken
considering the fact that the accused was involved in five different cases
registered at different places with similar allegations.
16.          Besides this, the conduct of the accused is also evident from the
affidavit dated 29.5.2013 filed by Manmeet Singh, Deputy Superintendent
of Police, State Cyber Crime Police Station, SAS Nagar, wherein it is
mentioned that after grant of bail, the accused had been absented from the
court. Non-bailable warrants were directed to be issued. In FIR No. 199
dated 5.12.2010, registered under Sections 420, 120-B IPC, Police Station,
Model Town, Ludhiana, he was declared proclaimed offender on 9.4.2013.
Still further, despite the fact that on 21.5.2012, this court restrained release
of the accused from jail in case he was in custody, without pointing out the
aforesaid order to the court concerned or Jail Superintendent, where he was
in custody, he was able to get himself released on 28.5.2012. It is not that
the accused is only guilty for this. Even the Investigating Agencies are
equally responsible, as the order passed by this court was not brought to the
notice of the concerned persons/court. The conduct of the accused even
after he was released on 28.5.2012 shows that he has no respect for law. He
hoodwinked the Investigating Agency for more than 10 months and
surrendered only after the accounts maintained by the company, the accused
and other Directors, the information of which could be collected, were
seized and all transactions therein were stopped.
 CRM No. 10956 of 2012                                      [8]

17.         Considering the aforesaid circumstances, in my opinion, the
bail already granted to accused-Rajesh Kumar on 23.3.2011 deserves to be
cancelled. Ordered accordingly.
18.         Before parting with the order, this court would like to place on
record a word of caution for the Investigating Agencies to sensitize the
Investigating Officers and also put a system in place whereby details about
an accused being involved in different cases is available with the
Investigating Agencies in all the cases and the courts concerned are also
apprised about the same. It shall not be limited to the pending cases. Even
the cases in which persons had been accused, may be acquitted or convicted
or have already undergone sentence, are also relevant to be placed before
the court, after the accused are arrested, as the same may be relevant for the
purpose of consideration of their prayer for anticipatory bail, regular bail,
conviction and/or sentence.
19.         The file be consigned to records.

                                                   (Rajesh Bindal)
