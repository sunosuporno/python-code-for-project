THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON

THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 Crl.M.C.Nos.2217/2022, 2893/2022 & 5362/2022


                                    ..6..


                                 ORDER

      The petitioner in all the above three Crl.M.Cs. is one and

the same. The de facto complainants in all the three cases are

Doctors.

      2.      Three different crimes (Crime No.424/2021 of Manjeri

Police Station, Crime No.5/2021 of Cyber Crime Police Station, Alappuzha and

Crime No.11/2021 of Cyber Crime Police Station, Kannur)   were registered

against the petitioner alleging offences punishable under

Sections 354A & 509 of the IPC (Crime No.424/2021 of Manjeri Police

Station),   Sections 354A, 354D(1)(ii) & 509 of the IPC, Section 4

r/w 3 Kerala Healthcare Service Persons and Healthcare

Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage to

Property) Act, 2012 & Section 67(iii) of the Information

Technology Act, 2000 (Crime No.5/2021 of Cyber Crime Police Station,

Alappuzha)   and Sections 354A(1)(iii), 354D(1)(ii) and 509 of the

IPC, Section 4 r/w 3 Kerala Healthcare Service Persons and

Healthcare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and

Damage to Property) Act, 2012 & Section 67A of the

Information Technology Act, 2000 (Crime No.11/2021 of Cyber Crime

Police Station, Kannur).
 Crl.M.C.Nos.2217/2022, 2893/2022 & 5362/2022


                                 ..7..

     3.    The allegation in all the three cases is that, on

28.8.2021, while the de facto complainants in all the three

crimes were consulting with the patients through on-line as

part of Govt. programme (e-sanjivani), the petitioner followed

the de facto complainants through the above consultation

programme with sexual intent and showed the scene of

masturbation    and    thereby   committed     sexual   harassment

against the women healthcare service personnel.

     4.    The definite case of the petitioner is that he is a

mentally ill person. It is specifically stated that he happened

to be involved in drugs racket and became an addict for drugs

and alcohol while he was studying for B.Sc.-MIT at A.J.

Institute of Medical Science and Research Centre, Mangalore in

2012-'13 batch. It is further stated that the addiction to drugs

and alcohol developed anti-social personality disorder in him

and he became exhibitionistic and was undergoing treatment

in various hospitals. It is submitted that the alleged offences

were committed not intentionally but consequent to his

disease mentioned above.           The petitioner has produced
 Crl.M.C.Nos.2217/2022, 2893/2022 & 5362/2022


                                   ..8..

documentary evidence to show that he is suffering from such

disease. It is in these circumstances, all these Crl.M.Cs. have

been filed to quash the proceedings.

     5.    Since this Court was prima facie satisfied that the

petitioner was suffering from the disease mentioned above, a

direction was given to the learned Senior Public Prosecutor,

Smt.T.V.Neema to ascertain from the concerned de facto

complainants/Doctors whether they are willing to condone the

acts of the petitioner taking into account the mental condition

of the petitioner. Accordingly, Smt.T.V.Neema, the learned

Senior Public Prosecutor took pain to contact all the de facto

complainants     and    interact   with    them.   They   have    fairly

submitted that they are prepared to condone the alleged act of

the petitioner and they do not want to proceed with the cases

further against the petitioner. Written sworn statements from

all the three de facto complainants have also been received

and produced before this Court.

     6.    For    the    reasons       stated   above,    all    further

proceedings against the petitioner in Crime No.424/2021 of
 Crl.M.C.Nos.2217/2022, 2893/2022 & 5362/2022


                                 ..9..

Manjeri Police Station, Crime No.5/2021 of Cyber Crime Police

Station, Alappuzha and Crime No.11/2021 of Cyber Crime

Police Station, Kannur are hereby quashed.

      7.   The    petitioner's   father,   through    whom   these

Crl.M.Cs. have been filed, shall ensure that the petitioner does

not repeat the act.

      Crl.M.Cs. are allowed as above.
