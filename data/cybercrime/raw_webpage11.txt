		The present criminal original petition has been filed seeking a direction to the respondent to register a case based on the complaint given by the petitioner dated 17.12.2015. 
		2.It is stated in the affidavit that the marriage between the petitioner and one Mr.Goutham took place on 22.05.2013.  During their matrimonial life, the petitioner was being tortured by her husband and in laws. Hence, the petitioner lodged a complaint before the All Women Police Station and the same is pending for enquiry.  The petitioner's husband has also filed a divorce pending before the Family Court, Chennai.  On 15.12.2015, the petitioner was shocked to find out that her face book account, G-mail account and other personal accounts were hacked by her husband. Immediately, the petitioner changed the password of all her personal accounts, as the petitioner's husband was misusing her personal accounts.  When the petitioner was browsing in the internet, the petitioner was surprised to see that  a new facebook account was opened in her name by her husband using the petitioner's photos and the petitioner's husband was misusing the profile by posting obscene messages and photos and sharing it in the public. These actions of the petitioner's husband have caused a great disrespect to the petitioner and her family among the society and as such, the petitioner become mentally depressed.  Hence, the petitioner had sent a complaint by Registered post to the respondents on 17.12.2015. But, till date no action was taken.  Therefore, the petitioner has filed the present criminal original petition.
